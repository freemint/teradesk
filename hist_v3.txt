Version 3.83
------------
- Code for handling compatibility with a bug in earlier versions of the
  configuration file removed. As a result, if configuration files older
  than V3.82 are loaded, visibility of directory fields has to be set again.

- As the number of translations of TeraDesk grew (so far, beside English
  original, there are Russian, German, French and Greek) it was felt that
  certain explanations regarding DESKTOP.RSC were needed. Therefore, a new
  file named RESOURCE.TXT was created. It contains comments intended
  to help people translating TeraDesk to other languages. It will be
  available in the source code package.
 
- Some changes made in the resource file. See RESOURCE.TXT 

- Changed behaviour of the Info... dialog when displaying data on disk
  volumes (partitions). In earlier versions, retrieval of these data took
  unpleasantly long time, especially on large partitions, because all files
  and folders on the volume were counted. Now, only information on disk 
  size, used and free space is immediately displayed, and folder/file 
  count is displayed only after pressing the 'More' button.

- Text "Number of files and links" in the Info... dialog is now, more 
  correctly, "Number of files" in single-TOS.

- Removed the possibility of too long filenames appearing in some alerts.

- More informational file-selector titles now appear in fileselectors
  invoked from some editable dialog fields.

- Fixed unwanted change of titles in iconified windows when changing
  visibility of directory fields.

- Fixed possible buffer overrun with autolocator active in mint.

- Fixed a bad redraw problem that manifested when doing real-time window 
  moving/sizing in Magic-PC.

- Fixed a redraw problem that manifesed when left/right scrolling a
  directory window with selected items.

- Optimized the number of GEM calls, exchange of AES messages and some 
  waiting for timer events when resizing or moving windows. Response should 
  be quicker now.

- Certain simplifications and optimizations were made. Program size is now
  less than it was in V3.80. 


Version 3.82
------------
- Corrected display of size, free and used space when showing information
  on large disk partitions. Up to 1024 GB should be correctly displayed. 
  For partitions larger than 1 GB, size data is displayed in kilobytes, 
  not in bytes. It ought to be noted that there is still a 2GB limit on the
  total size and 32767 on the count of files in an open directory or in a 
  list of selected items for a file operation (copying, deleting, etc.). 

- Fixed a redraw problem that existed during real-time resizing of directory
  windows in XaAES.

- Fixed a bug that could crash TeraDesk when responding to AV_DRAG_ON_WINDOW
  AV-protocol message.

- Fixed an instance of using a deallocated memory block when launching
  applications assigned to documenttypes. Application start parameters
  could get corrupted.

- Fixed an old bug (since V3.0!) that disabled assignment of the last icon 
  in the icons resource file (any assignment made was lost after saving and 
  loading the configuration file).

- Corrected the somewhat ilogical beaviour of the dialog that appears
  when more than one application is assigned to a filetype. Now the first 
  application in the displayed list is preselected, so that the user does 
  not have to explicitely click on a list item to select it.

- Corrected response to Mint's arrogant tampering with filenames: when 
  reading directories, if Dpathconf(path,DP_CASE) inquiry returns 
  DP_NOSENSITIVE (i.e. value "1", meaning that filenames are not 
  case-sensitive and are converted to uppercase), names are now really 
  converted to uppercase. Names in partitions where case-sensitive names
  are permitted are, of course, displayed in original case.

- Substantial changes in window-iconifying code in order to better adjust 
  it to recent developments in XaAES. Iconified windows are now moved to
  positions and sizes determined by the AES, instead of remaining at 
  previous locations and hard-coded iconified sizes. Recommended size
  of iconified window (when it can be set in the AES) is 80 x 64 pixels
  or 88x72 pixels (divisible by 8 and depending on window border thickness
  in a particular AES; this is about the minimum window size into which an
  icon with a 12-characters label can nicely fit).

- Enabled 'light' display of icons for hidden files on the desktop. This
  works nicely only in XaAES and MyAES- other AESes display 'disabled' 
  icons in a very ugly way - the complete object rectangle is shaded, 
  not only the icon mask. 'Light' display of icons for hidden files in
  directory windows is possible (in any AES), at least for the time being,
  only if window background is white, to allow for incapabilities of 
  most AESes (the user may decide not to put a hidden file on the desktop
  if it looks ugly, but such a file may appear in a window out of his 
  control, therefore this safe approach).

- Slightly modified calculation of default window sizes and positions.

- Certain amount of source code cleanup and several size optimizations.
  Program size actually reduced a little bit, in spite of added fixes.

- Added some currently inactive code that will be used in future development.

- Support for CFG2INF convertor of V2 configuration files completely dropped
  as obsolete.

- A number of mistakes in the hypertext help corrected and some items
  updated.


Version 3.81
------------
- Added "https:" as a recognized name prefix for network objects.

- Optimized for size the routines for floppy formatting and error reporting;
  somewhat improved description of BIOS/XBIOS errors that can be encountered
  during formatting (and on other occasions).

- Fixed a bug in starting background applications (application started
  twice in the multitasking version of TeraDesk).

- Fixed a bug that could corrupt Disk copy dialog if wildly wrong format
  parameters were read from a floppy.

- Fixed a bug that sometimes caused double backslashes to appear in 
  file specifications passed to fileselectors.

- Corrected the somewhat ilogical behaviour of 'Save options' not saving
  to TERADESK.INF but to last configuration file loaded.

- Made several improvements in detection of too long paths and names.

- Removed some inappropriate checks that, in the previous version, disabled
  passing of multiple names through some AV-protocol commands.

- Improved recognition of quoted names when parsing commands entered in 
  Open... dialog or received through AV-protocol.

- Corrected display of file size in File rename dialog.

- Corrected handling of links and icons of network objects when printing
  files and directories.

- Provisions added for handling some absurdly long strings that can be 
  received through AV-protocol from applications accessing the internet.

- Made some corrections in DESKTOP.RSC (a note to translators):
  .Corected duplicate hotkey assignments in dialog SPECAPP
  .Changed texts in alerts AFMTERR and AERRACC
  .Added strings TBADS, TXBERROR, TSEEKE and TUNKM (in that order)

- Rephrased and corrected some paragraphs in the hypertext help, and 
  removed some paragraphs related to obsolete items.


Version 3.80 (provisionally named V3.71 during development)
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Improved handling of cases where one filetype is assigned to more than
  one application. Earlier versions of TeraDesk just ignored multiple
  assignments; now, a dialog is shown when a multiply-associated file(type)
  is to be opened, permitting the user to select among the assigned
  applications (editing of application parameters in the displayed list
  is not possible).

- When a symbolic link is created (by selecting an object and activating
  New... menu item), name of the referenced object is shown in the dialog
  and can be edited, as well as the name of the link itself.

- Objects on a network, to be accessed via the http, ftp or mail protocols,
  can be specified as referenced objects in symbolic links. Such a symbolic
  link can not be directly created (though it could be made so, with a
  network-access application supplying the necessary information through
  AV_COPYFILE message); instead, a link to an existing file should be
  created and then edited (see above) so as to point to the desired object.
  Referenced objects should have names beginning with one of the following
  prefixes: http:, ftp: or mailto:; 'Follow links' option is ignored for
  such symbolic links.

- Objects on a network, as above, can be specified in desktop icons.
  Icon type 'File/Folder' should be selected in the Set desk icons...
  dialog and then 'Path' field edited to point to the desired object. This
  option works in single-TOS as well. The feature exists in parallel with
  the capability to create desktop icons for symbolic links pointing to
  network objects, as above.

- Network objects, as above, can be assigned as 'document types' to
  applications. Name masks like e.g.  http:*,  http://*, http://*.htm etc.
  should be specified in Mint or Magic. Supported prefixes are currently
  http, ftp and mailto (case insensitive). In single-TOS, because of
  name limitations, these masks should be specified as e.g. HTTP*.*, etc.

- Network objects with names matching 'document types' specified as above
  can be opened from the 'Open...' dialog; the appropriate application will
  be started, or, if it is already running, a VA_START command will be sent
  to it.

- When returning from a subfolder in a directory window, window sliders
  are now set to previous positions in the parent directory. If the window
  has been resized while in the subfolder, sliders are set so as to show
  the subfolder item which has just been closed.

- Improved detection of filesystem capabilities regarding long filenames.

- Changed algorithm for wildcard matching so that some long names are better
  matched, e.g. those containing multiple periods (dots).

- Space characters (<SP>) can be typed in the autoselector when long
  filenames are available- this did not work in the previous version.

- Fixed a problem of typing certain characters in dialog fields on German
  keyboard, and also fixed some other related problems in dialogs.

- Enabled the use of ^0 to ^9 and <BS> as keyboard shortcuts. Also disabled
  possibly dangerous wrong recognition of some key combinations (e.g. ^- was
  recognized as ^<DEL>, ^<Left> as ^S, etc.).

- Fixed a bug which disabled manipulation of TeraDesk's nonmodal font
  selector if any other dialog was opened (however, it is still not
  possible to open more than one instance of font selector at a time).

- [Shift][Tab] can be used to move the cursor up/back in dialogs.

- Made some other adjustments to make TeraDesk partially compatible with
  the new keyboard-navigation feature of XaAES, but only for the menu and
  the editable fields (at least for the time being; this is more-less limited
  to correctly setting the focus). Anyway, dialog buttons can be directly
  activated in TeraDesk from the keyboard by Alt+letter combinations.

- A small improvement made in the shutdown procedure (unwanted messages are
  ignored while a shutdown is in progress).

- Fixed the problem of VA_START routine not finding already running
  applications in Magic, if applications' names were specified in lowercase.

- Fixed the problem of editable dialog fields for paths being shorter than
  maximum permitted path length.

- Disabled entering of full paths through the fileselector activated from
  editable text fields in cases where names only were expected, and v.v.

- Fixed the problem of not being able to read extremely long directory
  window paths that could be previously saved to the configuration file.

- Fixed several cases of possible buffer overflows when manipulating
  extremely long paths.

- Plugged a couple of memory leaks in the AV-protocol and application-
  startup routines.

- Fixed a bug which could crash TeraDesk if palette loaded from the file
  had more colours than the current palette.

- Fixed a freeze that could sometimes occur if file operation on a single
  item failed (dialog could not be closed).

- Fixed a bug which caused improper execution of some operations from the
  'File' menu upon the file in the top text window.

- Fixed boring multiple interrogation attempts on ejected removable drives;
  a bug related to this problem crashed TeraDesk in Magic.

- Corrected setting of default directory when starting a program in Magic
  (some applications could not find their files).

- Corrected a very old (V2.* ?) but hitherto unnoticed bug which could crash
  TeraDesk when unexpected AES messages (e.g. WM_ARROWED, when using a
  wheeled mouse in XaAES) were received in windowed dialogs.

- Corrected display of object size in the name-conflict dialog when copying
  folders.

- Corected the content in the dialog when name mask, program type or
  icon type dialog is opened when a file/folder is selected.

- Made a number of optimisations and rearrangements in order to keep program
  size down.

- Updated the hypertext manual; also added some previously missing
  information about older items.

- A note to translators of the resource file: in order to make the
  resource file of V3.70 compatible to the new version, the following
  changes have to be made in DESKTOP.RSC/DESKTOP.RSD:
  . 'Cancel' button in NEWDIR tree named NEWDIRC.
  . 'Name:' string in NEWDIR tree copied to a new string positioned two
    text lines lower; the text changed from 'Name:' to 'To:'; new text
    named NEWDIRTO and hidden.
  . 'Cancel' button in COPYINFO tree named 'COPYCAN'.
  . Strings METOUCH, MEREADDR and MICNOPEN deleted.
  . Alerts ANOCOPY, ANODRAGP and ANOPRINT deleted.
  . New trees (strings) MUNKNOWN, MNETOB, MNOCOPY, MNOPRINT,
    MNODRAGP, MNOOPEN and (alert) ACANTDO added.
  . Wording of several texts slightly changed, which probably doesn't
    matter much in a translation.
  . ob_flags for some scrolled-text FTEXT objects changed (bits 14 and 15).


Version 3.70
------------
- In order to reduce program size, removed some code which handled
  compatibility with earlier versions of configuration files. Oldest entirely
  acceptable version of configuration file is now 3.60; some portions of
  older configuration files may not be interpreted correctly by TeraDesk
  (see also remarks for previous releases in the history file).

- Autoselector feature is available- a way was found to add it with
  little cost in program size: directory items can be automatically
  selected as their names are typed on the keyboard. As this may collide
  with single-key keyboard shortcuts, the conflict is resolved in the
  following way:
  .If there are no single-key keyboard shortcuts defined, autoselector is
   always active. It is reset by the [Insert] key and the last character
   typed is deleted by the [Backspace] key.
  .If single-key keyboard shortcuts (other than [Tab] or [Delete]) are
   defined, autoselector must be toggled on/off by the [Insert] key, which
   also temporarily deactivates/activates keyboard menu shortcuts.
  .Autoselector is reset upon each change of the topped window, and also
   upon any directory refresh.
  .Items selected in the autoselector can be opened by pressing the [Return]
   key (because the keyboard shortcut assigned to 'Open' may be temporarily
   disabled by the autoselector; this is also a concession to compatibility
   with other desktops).

  This feature, being new in TeraDesk, probably still needs some refinement.

- Selected items can be deselected by the [Undo] key.

- File sizes and creation dates/times are shown in the name-conflict dialog.

- Improved manipulation with TeraDesk's configuration files:
  .If TeraDesk itself is installed in TeraDesk as the application for
   TERADESK.INF or similar files (e.g. T*.INF), then it can load a
   configuration file being double-clicked upon in a directory window or
   on the desktop. If DESKTOS.PRG is used, DESKTOP.PRG has still to be
   installed as the application (not DESKTOS.PRG).
  .If a TeraDesk's configuration file is selected in a directory window or
   on the desktop, then, upon activating 'Load settings...' menu item,
   TeraDesk immediately loads that file without opening the file selector.
  .Improved restoring of correct state in case of attempting to load a
   corrupted configuration file. If a good configuration file has been
   previously loaded after TeraDesk has been started, settings are restored
   from that file.

- Strings written to a configuration file (command lines for applications,
  icon labels, etc.) can now contain the "@" character.

- External application can be specified for file comparing through
  'Set special use'.

- A new option added to Window options dialog, enabling the user to select
  whether open windows will be saved in the configuration file (some users,
  including myself, prefer to always start with a clean desktop).

- Open and saved directory windows for which filename masks have not been
  explicitely set now reload with the filemasks default for the current
  operating system type (i.e. "*.*" in single-TOS or Geneva, "*" in
  Mint/Magic). This makes it easier to use the same configuration files both
  in single-TOS and multitasking environment. A mask for an open directory
  window is reset to default as above if the editable field 'File type:' is
  cleared in the Set Name Mask dialog and then 'OK' is clicked. This is now
  more similar  to the behaviour of the original TOS desktop.
  Note: explicitely set "*.*" or "*" mask is not treated as a default one.

- Single-TOS version of TeraDesk now always registers with AES as "DESKTOP";
  there is no need anymore to rename DESKTOS.PRG to DESKTOP.PRG in order for
  the AV-protocol to work with single-TOS version of TeraDesk (assuming the
  environment variable AVSERVER=DESKTOP is defined). This may simplify
  making multiple boot configurations.

- Rearranged and updated the Help dialog.

- 'Follow links' checkbox button moved from Copy and Print options to more
  logical places in the Copy confirmation dialog and Set desktop icon
  dialog, where the state of this option can be more easily monitored.
  'Follow links' option can be made active only for a single (batch)
  operation.

- 'Tab size' editable field moved from 'Desk preferences' dialog to a more
  logical place in Window options dialog.

- Improved handling of filenames and other parameters containing spaces and
  quote characters:
   . Names containing quotes can be handled now in the AV- and ARGV-protocols,
     and command lines for installed applications.
   . IUtems can be quoted by either single or double quotes.
   . Improved parsing of mixed single- and double-quotes in command lines.
   . Improved working of the ARGV protocol in Magic.
   . Corrected unwanted truncation of command line parameters after unused
     filename placeholders (%f, %n, %p) in command lines.

- Improved detection of filesystem capabilities (long names, symbolic links,
  attributes).

- Changed display of window title for iconified windows; item name/path
  is now shown in icon label (longer string available than in window
  title).

- Corrected display of partition size and free space for partitions larger
  than 2GB (32-bit long integer limit) in Show info...  However, TeraDesk
  will still incorrectly display total size of files in folders or during
  file operations if size exceeds 2GB, and also other unpredictable
  behaviour may occur in such cases. This is probably relevant only in a
  multitasking environment and non-TOS/FAT filesystems.

- Corrected counting of files and folders regarding global mask setttings
  (i.e. hidden and system items) for Show info... and file operations.
  Now such items are always counted even if they are not visible, because
  file operations (copy, delete...) are executed upon them anyway. It
  should be noted that the info line in a directory window displays the
  count of visible items only, which is affected by the name mask as well.

- Corrected inconsistent following of symbolic links when doing file
  copy/delete/touch operations. Now, only links directly selected in a
  directory window or on the desktop are followed when 'Follow links'
  option is selected. Any links in the subdirectories of a selected item
  are always worked upon as links.

- Fixed inconsistent deselection in directory windows after copy operations;
  items were sometimes deselected and sometimes were not. As the erroneous
  behaviour (keeping items selected) in fact turned out to be quite useful,
  a new option was added to 'Copy and Print....' dialog: 'Keep selection'.
  If it is ON, selected items will remain selected after all copy/move
  or drag-to-desktop operations. This is handy for multiple actions upon
  same items.

- Fixed a bug which corrupted drag&drop and some VA messages if more than
  one name was passed.

- Fixed several errors which, together, sometimes disabled 'touching' files
  in subdirectories and prevented resetting of 'archived' attribute on files
  in FAT partitions.

- Fixed a bug which sometimes disabled unprotecting of readonly files and
  generally caused inappropriate 'Access denied' alerts, e.g. when renaming
  directories, etc.

- Fixed needless interrogation of drive A: in some file operations
  (was manifested in Mint and Magic only).

- Reenabled the use of DEL character as a keyboad shortcut; this has been
  accidenatlly lost since V3.50 so that only ^DEL could be recognized.

- Corrected an instance of 'This application is already running' alert
  appearing when an object is dragged onto an icon of an already running
  application (the alert should not have appeared in that case). In order
  to increase flexibility, this  behaviour is modifiable by pressing the
  [Alternate] key.

- Better handling of failures to open dialogs (when there is insufficent
  memory or too many windows, etc.).

- Corrected a mistake in a validation string for 8+3 filenames in DESKTOP.RSC

- Several optimizations and simplifications made in the code.

- Some corrections, updates and additional links made in the hypertext
  manual.


Version 3.62
------------
- Added one hex digit to display of line offset in text windows in
  hexadecimal mode. Offset could not be displayed properly for files
  larger than 16MB. Now this limit has been increased to 256MB which should
  probably be enough for any practical purpose.

- Some small code optimizations related to display in text windows.

- Fixed a bug which disabled display of differing file contents in Compare...

- Corrected default file specification in fileselector invoked from
  scrolled text fields for the sake of some pedantic fileselectors.

- Corrected and somewhat optimized enabling/disabling of some menu items.

- Corrections made and some paragraphs rephrased in the hypertext manual.


Version 3.61
------------
- Some noncritical configuration-file-compatibility code removed; if
  configuration files OLDER than V3.60 are loaded, warnings may appear
  (to be ignored).

- When programtype name masks are added or removed, any matching window
  icons now change group (Programs vs. Files) automatically, in style with
  behaviour of desktop icons which automatically change their item types.

- Moved alternate validation and template strings for some editable dialog
  fields (for filenames, when switching from LFN to 8+3) from the code to
  the resource file, so they would be easier to manipulate. This may be
  needed if the user wishes to relax validation of filenames in single-TOS;
  with the validation string currently being set to FFFFFFFFFFF, some
  filenames which are not exactly legal, like "ST-GUIDE", can not be entered
  in the dialogs; to relax validation, TFNVALID string in DESKTOP.RSC
  should be changed to e.g. XXXXXXXXXXX or XXXXXXXXFFF

- Fixed a bug which caused font colour to change when font size was
  increased in the font-selector dialog.

- Fixed a bug which corrupted the screen because of improperly closed
  icon selector dialog when locating (re)moved objects associated with
  desktop icons.

- Fixed some bugs related to Info... and Search... functions:
  . Corrected behaviour of Search... and Info... after searching in a file
    displayed in a topped text window.
  . Fixed a bug which could crash the Single-TOS version of TeraDesk in
    the Info... dialog.
  . Corrected behaviour when attempting to read header flags from an
    invalid program file.

- Fixed a bug which disabled setting of "solid colour" (other than white)
  window background.

- Fixed a case of using a deallocated memory block when dragging objects
  from a directory window to the desktop; this error caused object path+name
  to be lost sometimes, and could crash TeraDesk. Users should beware that
  ANY ICONS CREATED IN V3.60 by dragging objects from directory windows
  to the desktop can have corrupt object path information.

- Fixed incorrect behaviour and possible crash after attempting to read
  files (to display, search or compare) too big for available memory.

- Partially corrected behaviour when attempting to open a dialog with
  insufficient memory available (more to do for the next release).

- Corrected unnecessary reset of 'fulled' state after some updates of
  directory windows.

- Corrected some mistakes in the hypertext manual.


Version 3.60
------------

- In order to accomodate other changes in this release, there are some
  modifications in the structure of the configuration file. As a consequence:
  . Some compatibility-handling code exists in this release, enlarging
    program size slightly; this code will be removed in the next release.
  . If configuration files created with TeraDesk OLDER than V3.50 are
    used, window fonts colours should be manually set in Window options...
    otherwise, nothing will be seen in windows if background is white.
  . Users should load and then save each configuration file.

- Better handling of user access rights and file attributes:
  . Access rights and user/group IDs can be set in the 'Info...' dialog.
  . When copying executable files from FAT to non-FAT partitions, execute
    rights are set now.
  . Better decision making on when to show access rights and when to show
    TOS/DOS attributes in a directory window.
  . User and group IDs can be shown in directory windows (selectable menu
    option, visible only in Mint or Magic).
  . Note: manipulations of access rights or FAT file attributes are mutually
    exclusive, depending on the filesystem in which the object resides
    (AFAIK no Atari-relevant file system uses both simultaneously?).

- Hypertext help file will be opened (upon [Shift][Help]) by any application
  installed for the *.HYP filetype. entry for the help program in the
  earlier version(s) of configuration files will be ignored.

- More than one selected item at a time can be opened by 'Open...' menu item.
  Files and folders are each opened in a new window. In single-TOS operation,
  opening of multiple items terminates if a program is started (because all
  windows are closed and reopened). In a multitasking environment, there
  is a delay of 2 seconds between starting of selected programs (so that
  each program is given some time to configure, shrink its memory, etc.).

- New menu item 'Close all' added in 'Window' menu. It closes all TeraDesk's
  windows, including those of signed-on AV-protocol clients.

- Improved functionality of the 'Search...' function:
  . It also works on a list of selected files or folders as well now,
    not only a single folder or a drive.
  . It works in a file showed in the topped text window.

- Improved functionality of the 'Set desk icons' dialog:
  . More than one desk icon at a time can be installed by dragging objects
    from a directory window to desktop.
  . Names of (file or folder) items to which the icons are assigned are
    displayed and editable.
  . Fourth desktop icon type ('File/Folder') radiobutton added; direct
    specification of object name in the dialog is possible.
  . Objects selected in a directory window can be set to the desktop
    through 'Set desk icons' menu action.
  . Desktop icons can be removed through the dialog; 'Remove icons'
    menu item item deleted as unnecessary.
  . Desktop icons can be removed by dragging them to the trashcan.
    An alert appears asking whether to remove the icons or to delete
    selected objects.
  . If label for a disk icon is not specified by the user when installing
    the icon, TeraDesk reads and uses the disk volume label.

- New window icons group added; beside 'Files' and 'Folders' there is
  now 'Programs'. This should speed-up opening of directory windows in icon
  mode in configurations with many window icons assigned, because smaller
  lists will have to be searched for each directory item.  Compatibility
  code exists which moves appropriate icons from the 'Files' group into
  the new group when old configuration files are loaded.

- Third default-directory option added to 'Program type' dialog: beside the
  top window and the program directory, the path of the first parameter
  of the command line can be set as the default directory. Some intelligence
  is used trying to detect a path in a command line which may contain other
  strings as well. Program type dialog somewhat rearranged.

- Appropriate dialog titles are shown when showing 'Info...' about some items
  (from the directories on the U:\ volume) which are not standard files or
  folders.  Maybe should be further enhanced to display e.g. device number,
  etc?

- Program header flags are displayed in the 'Info...' dialog for executable
  files. Name of the associated application is displayed for other files,
  if such an application is defined.

- When copying large files (larger than copy buffer size), number of
  remaining bytes is updated in the copy-info dialog after each buffer
  copied. Loss in speed is negligible.

- Items with names beginning with a '.' are treated as invisible in Mint,
  as per Unix convention.

- Directory window icons of invisible files are displayed faded. Currently
  this works only if window background colour is white- the 'disabled' flag
  is used to display them, and for a disabled object the complete object
  rectangle is disabled by all AESes, which looks very ugly with a window
  background pattern.  The inconvenience is similar to one appearing for
  disabled checkboxes and radiobuttons: AESes shade the complete object
  rectangle, instead of applying some inteligence to shade only what is
  needed. There is a chance that this will be improved at least in XaAES
  and MyAES.

- Icons of links are marked with a "check" mark. This is experimental and
  may yet be removed if it does not prove practical (or nice).

- Executable files are detected by their names/types upon opening of
  directories. However, this does slow down opening of directory windows
  somewhat. May yet be marked for optional compilation only. Introduction
  of this feature caused a small change in the structure of the
  configuration file.

- With directory windows in text mode, executable files are shown with '-'
  character preceding the name. This feature depends on the above change.

- Reworked wildcard matching to increase speed, so that slowdown caused
  by the previous changes is almost completely compensated for, especially
  so in single-TOS.

- When deleting, touching, moving or overwriting files, protection is checked
  (when possible) before attempting the operation, instead of relying on the
  return statuses of the GEMDOS/Mint functions (they seem to be of little
  relevance when working as a superuser).

- Added a capability to influence the implementation of the ARGV protocol;
  if environment variable TERAENV contains flag 'A', it will force
  TeraDesk to:
  . Always use ARGV on all program files which are declared to support it,
    regardless of the length of the command line;
  . Always build a local environment with ARGV appended and pass it
    to the program being started, bypassing the environment concatenation
    mechanism in shel_write().
  This may help solve some problems originating in differences (bugs?)
  of ARGV implementation in various AESes.

- A number of program size optimizations, in order to compensate for the
  increase in size caused by the new features. Still, the new version is
  about 3 KB larger than the previous one :(   Hopefully, the improvements
  are worth it.

- Some cleanup of the source code; a lot of comments added to the soruce.

- Disk volume labels are read using the more general (?) Dreadlabel() when
  possible, instead of using Fsfirst().

- Capability to edit disk volume labels in the Info... dialog was created,
  but only for Magic or Mint. Unfortunately, it seems that Dreadlabel() and
  Dwritelabel() behave too differently in Mint vs. Magic regarding dots and
  blanks in the label, so volume labels in the 8+3 form (e.g. as possible on
  floppies) may unwantedly get changed in Mint. Therefore, complete feature
  was disabled, at least for the time being.

- File copy routine simplified a bit.

- Some simplifications in DESKTOP.RSC.

- Files SPRINFT.C and STRDUP.C with substitutes of some library functions
  concatenated into a single file STRINGF.C to be used from now on;
  SPRINTF.H renamed to STRINGF.H

- Limited length (cramped) filenames displayed on icon labels in directory
  windows in icon mode, so that icon labels of long filenames do not
  overlap anymore.

- Better column alignment of texts beside the 'checkbox' buttons (when drawn
  by TeraDesk, not by an AES).

- When printing raw data, CR LF no more appended at the end of the file.

- Corrected positioning of the icon in the icon-selector in low resolutions
  (it overflowed the lower edge of the box).

- Corrected display of program name in dialogs related to installing
  applications, in case when name is entered manually.

- Corrected the routine for creating cramped names; it produced strings
  which were one character too short.

- Icon in the icon-selector dialog is displayed on a background of appropriate
  (desktop or window) colour and pattern. Icons can also be previewed in the
  selector in the selected state (when clicked upon).

- Sample text in the font selector can be previewed in the selected state
  too, when clicked upon.

- Improved (hopefully) reaction to an AP_TERM message received after
  TeraDesk initiates a shutdown.

- Fixed a bug (probably introduced in V3.40) which caused creation of
  symbolic links through 'New...' menu item to fail with 'Not enough memory'
  error.

- Fixed inappropriate sending of 'close window' messages. A routine which
  sends WM_CLOSED was overlooked in a routine which was used for other
  purposes. Hopefully this fixes a problem when starting an editor in aMail.

- Fixed unwanted topping of TeraDesk windows after closing the systemwide
  fileselector dialog, or the Info... dialog when requested through the
  AV protocol. Not ideal, but better than it was...

- Fixed some errors which affected manipulation of folders in Info...
  (errors were visible only in Mint).

- Fixed some errors in file-deleting: TeraDesk attempted to follow a link
  after it had been deleted. Routines simplified for single-TOS version.

- Fixed several instances of using memory blocks after they had been
  deallocated.

- Optimized selection of default icons; fixed a possible reference to a
  NULL pointer to icon name.

- Fixed (hopefully) a possible instance of buffer overflow when starting
  programs in single-TOS.

- Fixed a bug which could cause TeraDesk to crash while reopening windows
  after running a program in Single-TOS (window pointer for deselecting
  items existed but sometimes was no longer valid, as windows were reopened).
  It is not clear when was this bug created, possibly long ago...

- Windows of AV-protocol clients are no more closed when saving or loading
  desktop configuration. It seems that there is in fact no need to do it.

- Corrections and updates in the hypertext help/manual file, in order
  to reflect the latest changes.


Version 3.50
------------

- New basic sets of monochrome and colour icons. Hopefully these contain
  more useful icons than earlier did. Btw. some of the icon names from the
  old sets do not exist in the new ones.

- Removed the constraint (introduced in V3.0) of having to use a monochrome
  icon file whenever in monochrome video mode, even when colour icon file
  would do. Why not have animated monochrome icons when possible?

- Some tidying-up of the configuration file structure. Certain bitflag items
  moved from "copy options" data to other, more logical, places. As a result
  of this, certain options set in configuration files prior to V3.50 will be
  ignored:

  . State of "Save colours"    (OFF will be assumed)
  . State of "Dialog options"  ("centered" will be assumed)
  . State of "Wait for key after TOS programs" (OFF will be assumed)
  . State of "Use handle 2 for stderr" (OFF will be assumed)

  These options should be set as desired and the configuration file(s)
  saved anew. It is assumed that these differences are not significant
  enough to justify additional compatibility-handling code.

- Font colour can now be set in TeraDesk's font selector.

- If no selection is made, 'Search' is active in the top directory window.

- Added settable option to skip subfolders when searching for files.

- If a desktop disk icon is set without a drive letter, then icons for
  any missing disk volumes are set on the desktop, which eliminates
  the tedious one-by-one setting of disk icons.

- Added setting of basic Falcon video modes in Video options. For the time
  being it works only with some AES 4 versions, but not :(  with Falcon
  TOS 4.04. It works  Atari AES 4.1 (with or without Mint), Geneva and
  probably Magic (not tested yet), but not with current versions of XaAES
  or MyAES.  (Generally, it should work in all AESes which can handle
  shel_write(5,...) )

- Added "background" option in the application-type dialog. If selected,
  a TOS (non-GEM) application will be started as "background" in Mint- it
  will be basically just Pexec()-ed (same as starting it while [Control] is
  pressed). Works in single-TOS too, where found to be convenient for some
  simple utilities which do not write anything on the screen and there is
  no need to close the windows, clear the screen and display the program
  title bar (e.g. a sound-playing utility such as WAVEST).

- Improved handling of the "BORDERED" object flag for self-drawn in-dialog
  objects; actual border size is determined, as used by any particular
  AES, resulting in better looking dialogs in any AES which does not (yet?)
  support borders and/or particular object types in the standard way
  (i.e. MyAES). Visible mostly in the appearance of the dragbox "ear" on
  a dialog.

- Improved sizing of buttons with underlined keyboard-shortcut characters
  so that underlines are now seen in MyAES/monochrome.

- Keyboard shortcuts (underlined) in dialogs, when TeraDesk draws them
  (i.e. always except in Magic, XaAES or N.AES), are shown in different
  colour (red) when possible.

- Dialog titles, when TeraDesk draws them (i.e. always except in Magic,
  XaAES or N.AES) are drawn in colour (dark blue) when possible. Sizing
  of the title object slightly modified for better alignment.

- Some small optimizations in event-handling routines.

- Newest version of AHCM memory-allocation routines used.

- Somewhat relaxed validation for window icon name mask in single-TOS, so
  that an icon can be assigned to ".." (parent folder).

- Links pointing to items with paths containing slashes ("/") are now
  interpreted as if they contain backslashes ("\"). This hopefully fixes
  the problem of not finding link targets on minix or ext2 partitions.

- Some more work started on better handling of access rights; nothing
  visible to the user, yet.

- Corrected action taken upon WM_ONTOP message (i.e. there should be no
  window action taken, just the change of top window noted).

- Corrected dialog and window redraws when showing copy-info and
  name-conflict dialogs.

- Fixed a bug which restricted the use of FONT protocol only to signed-on
  AV-protocol clients.

- Fixed a possible instance of attempting to free a non-allocated memory
  block while doing VA_DRAGACCWIND.

- Fixed several instances of using data from memory blocks after they
  had been deallocated.

- Fixed a bug in implementation of AV-protocol which could lead to corrupted
  replies being sent to AV-clients (data for two replies overlapped).

- Fixed a bug which disabled 'Skip' action in a response to Skip/Abort
  alert during file operations such as copying or deleting.

- Fixed a bug in string conversion to uppercase which could have affected
  wildcard-matching with patterns containing digits.

- Fixed a bug which disabled recognition of other-than-ST video hardware.

- Fixed a bug, unfortunately introduced in V3.42, in rubberbox redraw when
  directory window was scrolled.

- Fixed a bug in the video-setting code; on a Falcon some ST-specific
  code was executed.

- Fixed a bug which disabled loading of colour palette. Also improved
  tolerance to loading palette sizes other than the current palette-
  palette file will not be rejected anymore but only colours in valid
  range will load.

- Fixed a bug in dialog-handling routines which could cause object index
  in a dialog to exceed tree extents. This was visible in 'Set mask'
  dialog when cursor keys were used.

- Fixed a bug in fulling a text window for large files (i.e. with more
  than about 2000 lines)

- Fixed some noncritical errors in the resource file.

- Some corrections made in the hyopertext manual.


Version 3.43 (never published, except for testing)
--------------------------------------------------

- Some small changes which soon evolved enough to be considered  as V3.50;


Version 3.42
------------

- Simplified calculation of default window sizes and positions.

- Improved speed (and code size) of wildcard-matching.

- Some other code size optimizations where speed is not critical.
  Program size reduced even more.

- Enabled opening of the fileselector upon a double click on a
  scrolled editable text field, as intended a long time ago.
  (previous use of [INSERT] key for this purpose is kept as well).

- Plugged a memory leak which could sometimes happen when starting
  installed applications.

- Improved checking of dates entered in file-info dialog.

- Improved redraw in the 'Help' dialog


Version 3.41
------------

- Simplification of routines for loading and saving configuration files.
  Also, eliminated saving of empty data structures, which will sometimes
  result in somewhat smaller configuration files. Slightly better
  tolerance to faulty configuration files.

- Simplification of routines for floppy formatting. An insignificant bug
  corrected.

- Some more code optimization and cleanup. Program size reduced by almost
  a kilobyte, now actually smaller than V3.32!

- Some corrections and additions in the hypertext manual.

- An alternative help application can be manually specified in the
  configuration file (defaults to ST-Guide). Any application used
  must know of VA_START and understand its syntax as used by ST-Guide
  (this was actaully added in V3.40 but was not properly documented).

- Fixed incorrect handling (cramping) of the names of selected files
  when using 'Compare...'  more than once.

- Improved a somewhat ilogical behaviour of the 'Search...' function
  when size range or search text are specified. In such cases only
  files will be name-matched now, not folders.

- 'Select all' in directory windows does not needlessly select the parent
  directories anymore.

- Better handling of missing icons, including the required ones. Missing
  icons  turned out to be a realistic situation  if icon resource file(s)
  were changed. Previous version of TeraDesk created ugly empty rectangles
  in windows then. Now TeraDesk attempts to use one of the default icons,
  according to item type, and if that does not succeed either, uses the
  first icon in the icons resource file. Also, an alert is displayed.


Version 3.40
------------

- Some size and speed optimizations.

- Option to automatically save desktop on exit (in Desk preferences).

- Reduction of sizes of confirmation dialogs for file deletion and printing
 (some empty space removed).

- Improvement of the 'Show/Edit/Cancel' dialog:
  . It is a dialog now (again), not an alert;
  . Added "Run" option  (treat the file as executable);
  . Added "With" option (select an application to open the file with);

- Improvement of the 'Print...' function; printing can be redirected
  to a file. Also, three printing modes now exist, selectable from the
  confirm-print dialog:
  . Text mode (lines wrapped; cr/lf inserted when appropriate);
  . Hex dump (hex-codes + ascii, 16 bytes shown per printer line);
  . Raw data (file sent to printer as it is);

- Improvement of 'Compare...': there is a dialog now to enter parameters;
  width of resync window can be specified.

- 'Reverse sort' option for directory windows added.

- Removed 'Show as text' menu item as redundant, in order to reduce size
  (if added back to desktop.rsc, TeraDesk can still be compiled to use it);
  'Show as icons' can be checked/unchecked. If a keyboard shortcut was
  defined for 'Show as text', an alert regarding 'shtx' record will
  be generated. Should be ignored and desktop saved anew (didn't want
  to bother with keeping compatibility for a single item).

- Switchable auto-arrangement of objects in directory windows
  (i.e. fit current window width as well as possible).

- Multicolumn display in directory windows in text mode if auto-arrange
  is set, whenever a window is wide enough.

- Improved action of 'Fuller' in directory windows:
  . Vertical size adjustment as well as horizontal. Works for text windows
    too. Any action which changes the dimensions of window contents now
    resets the 'fulled' state (without changing window size).
  . Two 'fulled' modes: 1) window is expanded only as much as needed to
    display contents; 2) if any [Shift] key is pressed while clicking on
    the fuller gadget, the window is expanded to all of desktop.

- Improved calculation of slider positions in icon display mode.

- Names of hiden files displayed in light (gray) type.

- Update of text window content with [Escape] (re-read file).

- Dragging a single file to a text window reads the file into the window.
  (turned out to be quite convenient and faster than opening new windows).

- Search can be aborted by pressing [Escape].

- 'Search finished' information issued.

- Improved detection of '3D' AESes.

- Introduced environment variable TERAENV (not obligatory)  for setting
  some configuration details which were not convenient to be set through
  the configuration file (e.g. had to be set -before- reading that file).
  Currently only "TERAENV=D" is understood: force TeraDesk to always draw
  all extended-type objects by itself, even if an AES supports them.

- Some improvements in handling of the 'Info...' dialog.

- Small improvement in handling of video mode(s).

- A redesign of desktop/window pattern and colour selector.

- Warning issued before change of video resolution (reset).

- An alert is displayed if an application fails to start (multitasking).
  Does not work in all AESes.

- Additional objects added to video-options dialog, as an anticipation
  for some changes planned for a future release. Currently set to invisible.

- Optimization of redraws in some dialogs (and after closing them).

- An alert is displayed when appropriate, asking whether to
  start another instance of a running application.

- 'Window bottomed' message is now understood and acted upon.

- Checks are made whether registered AV-protocol clients are still alive.
  This is done before each program start.

- Multiple registration of some AV-protocol clients avoided now.

- Links to folders are correctly sorted among folders now.

- Fixed a bug of using a noninitialized variable in setting program types
  (i.e. an uncontrolled value could appear).

- Fixed a bug in casting a windows-related structure.

- Fixed some minor bugs in applying background patterns.

- Fixed a bug related to AV-protocol and text windows.

- Fixed a bug which could cause the AV-protocol to crash TeraDesk in
  the unlikely case of Mint being run with memory protection over a
  TOS version lower than 2.06.

- Fixed some wrongly set object flags in DESKTOP.RSC

- Fixed a bug which could freeze TeraDesk in a windowed dialog when
  texts were translated to other languages (e.g. Russian).

- Fixed a bug in cancelling the loading of configuration files
  (i.e. it could not be cancelled).

- Fixed a bug which caused the entire configuration file to be rejected
  upon loading if a path to a saved window did not exist anymore.

- Fixed a bug in searching when file size range was specified.

- Fixed a bug which could cause a crash when dialogs were closed by UNDO
  button or 'Closer' gadget.

- Fixed an old bug (from V3.0) which could cause memory corruption upon
  an empty line in a configuration file.

- Updated the hypertext documentation, correcting a number of errors in it.


Version 3.32
------------

- Fixed a bug in memory allocation when composing the ARGV string;
  it could cause errors or even a crash at launching a program or exiting
  from a program.

- Fixed a bug which could lead to confusing environmental variables
  with identical trailing ends (e.g. PATH and ATH).

- Fixed a bug in checking string length when creating links.

- Fixed a bug which disabled entry of certain characters in the form
  for application path.

- Fixed a variable-initialization bug related to scrolled editable
  text fields in some dialogs.


Version 3.31
------------

- Corrected position of an object in desktop.rsc (Info... dialog).

- Fixed a bug in handling symbolic links without a path to the target.
  (path of the link is assumed now).

- Fixed a bug in passing parameters after the program name in VA_PROGSTART
  and in Open... dialog.

- Fixed a bug of not being able to display items with names starting
  with a character code > 127.

- Fixed a bug in redrawing dialog and windows after font changes.

- Fixed a bug in passing parameters via drag & drop.

- Fixed a bug which crashed the desktop if an attempt was made to
  open more than one item through Open...

- More relaxed application of VA_START and AV_EXIT to those AV-protocol
  clients which do not correctly sign-on / off with the AV-server.

- Improved the initial implementation of VA_PATH_UPDATE which interfered
  with the handshake for some other AV-protocol messages; a client could
  freeze during some operations.

- Improved cycling of AV-protocol-client windows.

- Improved display of item names during copying/moving/deleting.

- Positions and sizes of iconified windows are correctly saved in the
  configuration file.

- Redesigned routines for enabling/disabline menu items depending on
  the context; this resulted in reduction of code size, welcome to counter
  the increase caused by other changes.

- More logical calculation of total items size in info lines of directory
  windows- only items matching the current mask (i.e. visible ones)
  are summed up.

- Better handling of a TOS 2.06 bug that manifested itself as a need
  for an additional mouseclick after (and sometimes before) a program
  was started, and there were no windows open. Version 3.30 did not
  work well in this respect with unpatched TOS 2.06 (possibly relevant
  in TOS 3.06 as well ?)

- Clicking on desktop area now properly tops TeraDesk (may not work with
  all AESes).

- Some left-over strings moved from the code to the resource file.

- More relaxed treatment of character codes in order to enable dialog
  and menu hotkeys with characters particular to other languages
  (the upper half of the 256-character set).


Version 3.30
------------

- Added special use flag for external viewer.

- Fixed a bug which sometimes caused copying from one disk to another
  when icons were moved on the desktop.

- Path of the symbolic link is appended if the link contains only the name
  of the referenced object, without a path to it.

- Fixed some bugs related to AV-protocol.

- Fixed a bug in finding next or previous windows.

- Some code optimisation.


Version 3.22 (never published, except for testing)
------------------------------

- Improved memory allocation system used (new version of AHCM), for
  better handling of large blocks.

- Fixed some bugs mostly related to local environment, AV-protocol
  and handling of symbolic links.

- Better handling of iconified windows.


Version 3.21 (never published, except for testing)
--------------------------------------------------

- Drag & drop protocol repaired (TeraDesk acts as a sender only).

- Restore-mode copying enabled by [RShift] (overwrite newer files only).

- Updated and rearranged dialogs with help on keyboard commands.


Version 3.20 (or 3.2; never published, except for testing)
----------------------------------------------------------

- Even more (almost all) AV-protocol messages supported.

- Update-mode copying enabled by [LShift] (overwrite older files only).

- Somewhat better handling of symbolic links.


Version 3.10 (or 3.1; never published, except for testing)
----------------------------------------------------------

- More general flagging of installed application for speciual use(s); new
  (sub)dialog created; can mark several roles for special apps; a mechanism
  created to mark them for some other functions as well, if need appears.

- As a result of the above, editor-specific functions are not needed
  anymore; edit.c and edit.h files removed from the project.

- Added window duplicate function.

- Moved window-related menu items under a new menu title "Window".

- Much larger subset of AV-protocol messages handled; TeraDesk is now
  a passable AV-server!

- Repaired the system-wide font selector callable via FONT protocol (e.g.
  from ST-Guide, Multistrip, etc.) (this was inherited from previous
  version but in fact did not work well).

- Repaired handling of ARGV protocol in Mint and Magic.

- Repaired Info... of the topped directory window; info on a file in the
  topped text window can be shown as well.

- Local per-installed-application environment.

- Symbolic links can be created, edited, deleted, copied...

- More logical interpretation of links when "opening" items: real item
  names are checked for, and real file names passed as parameters.

- When dialogs are in window mode, added a closer widget which acts the
  same as Cancel button.

- Removed "normal" dialog mode.

- Removed startup batch file capability from the project; batch.c and
  batch.h files removed from the project.

- Some small improvements in shutdown procedure. Also, if mint is detected,
  "Shutdown(2)" is activated at the very end, causing system restart.

- Some small improvements in video options dialog.

- New command line variable: beside %f and %n, added %p (path).


Version 3.02 (never published)
------------------------------

- Source code cleanup; removed remains of support for the binary
  configuration file; removed disabled old code for directory handling.

- Fixed a bug in left/right scrolling of text windows

- Fixed some errors in desktop.rsc

- More consistent application of string sizes for long names and commands
  (still not quite systematically applied).


Version 3.01
------------

- Restored full functionality of the name-conflict dialog.

- Repaired a bug in cookie finding routine (inherited from V2.*) which
  could sometimes make TeraDesk practically unusable if the cookie jar did
  not exist.

- Better fix for a TOS 2.06 bug related to ignoring the first mouse click
  after execution of a GEM program if no windows were open.

- Fixed a bug which disabled seting of configuration file name in the
  startup .BAT file (btw. should startup file feature be considered
  obsolete- does not seem to be of much use anymore?)

- Fixed bad window redraw in icon mode with XaAES.

- Fixed bad redraw in font-selector listbox with XaAES. (these two were
  probably faults of XaAES (V0.963), not TeraDesk)

- Correctly rebuilt the binary (previous version was linked wih a wrong
  binary module; could cause a crash under memory protection).

- Set exit with "OK" from "Video options..." to always redraw complete
  desktop, as a help to recover after screen corruption.

- Some code size optimizations.

- Some improvements and additions in TERADESK.HYP


Version 3.0
-----------

H. Robbers:

- Configuration data now in text mode. Easy to keep compatability. Name of
  textmode confguration file is TERADESK.INF.

- Program cfg2inf.prg for converting the binary cfg to the textmode inf.

- Colour palette is saved in a separate file TERADESK.PAL.

- Replaced use of Malloc (Gemdos) to standard malloc. (replace all x_alloc
  by malloc and x_free by free, except 2 that were used for interrogation)
  This reduces memory fragmentation on the Gemdos level considerably,
  especially important in multitasking environments.

- Replaced Wout's mememory allocator by mine (AHCM). AHCM allows memory
  leak detection and reduces fragmentation even more by always allocating
  Gemdos blocks in whole multiples of chunk size.

- As a result of the above it wasn't possible anymore to shrink the start
  amount of 2000 directory entry structures (68 Kb). So I implemented a
  pointer array instead. It starts with 256 entries (1 Kb) and is mildly
  exponentially expanded when needed. The amount of memory used by the
  pointer array is so low that shrinking isn't vital anymore. The amount
  of entry structures never exceeds the actual amount present in the
  directory. (A slight but nice advantage is that sorting now takes place
  on the pointer array which only needs swapping around of 4 instead of 34
  bytes. :-)

- Removed more of older cfg version

- cfg2inf.prg: The editor string in the old config is converted to a flag
  for the (installed) editor in the new config. So it is preserved if the
  editor was installed.

Dj. Vukovic:

- Fixed a bug of not immediately refreshing a changed background
  pattern/colour in text windows;

- Fixed a bug of not correctly setting and so corrupting type of desktop
  icon in desktop icons dialog.

- Fixed some bugs which disabled printing of more than one file at a time;

- Fixed some bugs in scrolling text fields (cursor placement, padding...)

- Fixed a bug which swallowed the first char of command lines for .TTPs

- Corrected enabling/disabling of some menu items depending on context;

- Fixed two cases of not releasing allocated memory after use;

- Fixed bad redraw of animated colour icons;

- Fixed a bug of cv_fntoform() overrunning available dialog buffer;

- Removed some overlooked fixed keyboard shortcuts from previous version;

- Adjusted length of "filetype" dialog fields vs. allocated string length
  (dialog field was longer than permitted string length);

- Some fixes which (hopefully) will correct improper window and dialog
  redrawing with XaAES only (V0.963).

- A lot of source code cleaned up; also removed some commented-out code
  from previous versions;

- Some optimization of desktop.rsc and use of it; removed unnecessary
  alerts, reused some strings, etc.

- Significant reduction of code size by reorganizing routines and data
  structures related to text and directory windows, so that same code is
  used for both window types;

- Integrated dialogs, routines and data structures regarding
  filetype-selectors, so that there is only one filetype-selector dialog
  in desktop.rsc; significant reduction in executable code size because a
  lot of routines are made to work on all file/filetype lists.  New files:
  lists.c and lists.h

- Reorganization of "Install Application" function, so that a dialog is
  shown displaying a list of installed applications. Reduction in code
  size because of modifications in several routines.

- Same concept is used for entering/editing all lists: filetype masks,
  program types, window icon filetypes and applications. It is possible to
  select an item from the list and manually edit it (i.e. two dialog
  levels), or to select an item in a window and then immediately open a
  second-level dialog to edit the entry.

- ALL dialogs now fit ST-low resolution. Some are reduced in size even
  more for faster redraws on low-end machines

- Several small fixes and improvements in floppy formatting routines;

- Target floppy drive is locked during formatting/copying in Mint & MagiC;

- Somewhat improved handling of overscan hack (tested with Lacescan);

- Improved operation of the "fuller" gadget- fulled window is moved left
  until it is completely on the screen;

- Improved operation of the "fuller" gadget for text window in "hex" mode-
  window is made only as wide as needed;

- Created "pressed" 3d effects when arrows pressed in Window Optons and
  Desk Preferences;

- Added window iconify/deiconify capability in AESes which  support it
  (AES4.1, Geneva, Magic, XaAES...)

- Cosmetic change: added left margin to text windows;

- Added checking for duplicate entries in filemasks, program types,
  window icons and applications lists;

- Added possibility to properly cancel changes in filemasks list;

- Added posibility to start an application or program type in
  "no-multitasking" mode in Magic (not working very well yet);

- Added possibility to limit memory available to a program type or
application.

- Added capability to mark an installed application as "autostart";

- Added capability of "Search" to find text in files as well;

- Added "touch" ((re)set date and/or attributes) functionality; user
  interface implemented through additional button in the "Object info"
  dialog. Considerable reorganisation of that dialog(s). TeraDesk is now
  able to display DOS/Windows folder attributes though not able to change
  them.

- While copying files it is possible to change date/time and attributes.

- Added "Compare files" functionality;  a nice knack is that it
  resynchronizes search positions after a found difference.

- Improved "Open..." function; it now tries to figure out what type of
  item should be opened: a program, a folder/drive, a file assigned as a
  document to application, or an unassigned file. In case of a
  program/application, it is possible to enter a comand tail after
  path+name;

- Command line dialog for TTP programs remembers last command if program
  name has not changed.

- Filename/filetype entry forms in dialogs appear in 8+3 length if there
  is no long-filename-capable OS present (i.e. without Mint or Magic);

- Much improved appearance of dialog elements, especially in 3D AESes; 3D
  effects are properly drawn when needed. Significant reorganization and
  simplification of routines for progdefined objects in xddraw.c;

- [Shift[[Help] calls ST-Guide (if available) to display TERADESK.HYP;

- Cramped_name() used for nicer display of long window titles;

- Improved recognition of TOS and AES versions and their capabilities
  and limitations.

- Added capability to call a file selector in scrolled text fields;
  upon pressing the [Insert] key

- As "Print" option now exists in the menu, that option has been removed
  from the Show/Edit/Cancel dialog and an alertbox is used instead of the
  dialog

- Updated the .HYP documentation.
