FIST STEPS
----------
Verify the version number  of the Tera Desktop  and the IT resource  file:
they should match. If they don't, go  over the Teradesk web page to  check
for updates or compatibily notes:

http://solair.eunet.rs/~vdjole/teradesk.htm  

If no update/notes  are available,  we firmly  advice to  NOT PROCEED  ANY
FURTHER !!!                                                                                                                           

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
----------------------
- Backup first the original  DESKTOP.RSC located inside the main  Teradesk
  folder (eg. C:\TERADESK\).
- rename/delete the DESKTOP.RSC (eg. rename it in DESKTOP.RSX)
- Copy the  Italian DESKTOP.RSC file  from the source  folder to the  main
  Teradesk folder.
- Start/Restart  the Tera  Desktop.  If the  desktop  opens, and  you  can
  correctly operate it, the procedure was successfull.


IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG:
------------------------
If Teradesk crashes on start,  or when a dialog  box is opened, or  simply
some dialog  look weird  or doesn't  work  as expected,  it might  be  the
symptom of a damaged or wrong Resource file.

The only cure is  to restore the original  Resource file (DESKOP.RSC)  you
have backed up and restart the Desktop. Check for updates on:
