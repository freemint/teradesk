FIRST STEPS
-----------
Verify the version number  of the Tera Desktop  and the FR resource  file:
they should match. If they don't, go  over the Teradesk web page to  check
for updates or compatibily notes:

             http://solair.eunet.rs/~vdjole/teradesk.htm 

If the versions doesn't match or the compatibility notes doesn't allow it,
we we firmly advice to NOT PROCEED ANY FURTHER !!!

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
----------------------
- Backup first the original  DESKTOP.RSC located inside the main  Teradesk
  folder (eg. C:\TERADESK\).
- rename/delete the DESKTOP.RSC (eg. rename it in DESKTOP.RSX)
- Copy the  French DESKTOP.RSC  file from the  source folder  to the  main
  Teradesk folder.
- Start/Restart the Tera Desktop.  If you end up  in the desktop, and  you
  can correctly operate it, the procedure was successfull.

IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG:
------------------------
If Teradesk crashes on start,  or when a dialog  box is opened, or  simply
some dialog  look weird  or doesn't  work  as expected,  it might  be  the
symptom of a damaged or wrong Resource file.

The only cure is  to restore the original  Resource file (DESKOP.RSC)  you
have previously backed up and restart the desktop. Check for updates on:
