This version of Teradesk supports MinT, MultiTOS, MagiC and Geneva.
Unfortunatly
the ARGV protocol does not work properly on these operating systems.
On MultiTOS the maximum length of the commandline is limited to
127 characters with the ARGV protocol. Geneva crashes if the ARGV
protocol is used.
