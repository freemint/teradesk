CFG2INF is a utility which can convert binary configuration files
of TeraDesk V2.* into text configuration files of TeraDesk 3.*;
The program is basically a hacked compilation of TeraDesk itself, 
containing both the old code which can read old binary configuration 
files, and new code to write text configuration files.

Use CFG2INF.PRG to read old configurations of TeraDesk, then Save
settings, or Save settings as...; do not use CFG2INF for other
purposes, as some other functions may not work or may work only
partially. When you are finished converting files, you'd best
dump CFG2INF.PRG to the trash bin.

CFG2INF.PRG uses DESKTOP.RSC of TeraDesk V3.00; do not attempt to
put it in a directory containing any other version of Teradesk, 
one of them would surely not work correctly because of different
resource files.

Icon files (ICONS.RSC and/or CICONS.RSC) used by TeraDesk must be 
present in the directory where CFG2INF.PRG is.
