CFG2INF is a utility which can convert binary configuration files of 
TeraDesk V2.* into text configuration files of TeraDesk 3.*; The program is 
basically a tweaked compilation of TeraDesk V3.01, containing both the old 
code which can read old binary configuration files, and new code which can 
write text configuration files.

Use CFG2INF.PRG to read old configurations of TeraDesk, then Save settings, 
or Save settings as...; do not use CFG2INF as a desktop, as some other 
functions may not work or may work only partially. When you are finished 
converting files, you'd best dump CFG2INF.PRG to the trash bin.

CFG2INF.PRG uses DESKTOP.RSC of TeraDesk V3.01, but renamed to CFG2INF.RSC
in order to enable coexistence of CFG2INF with newer versions of TeraDesk
in the same folder. Changing of the name of the resource file and changing
of the program version was done in the executable file; anyone attempting 
to recompile CFG2INF from TeraDesk 3.01 sources should make appropriate 
changes in the source code of V3.01.

Icon files (ICONS.RSC and/or CICONS.RSC) used by TeraDesk must be present 
in the directory where CFG2INF.PRG is.
