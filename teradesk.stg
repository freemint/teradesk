@{U}1.1  About Tera Desktop                                       TeraDesk@{u}

Tera Desktop (TeraDesk) is a replacement for the ST, STE, TT or Falcon
desktop. It provides more facilities than the built-in TOS desktop.

TeraDesk is  currently  the  only  open-source desktop  available  for
16-bit and 32-bit  Atari computers.  The developers' goal has  been to
maintain TeraDesk as a small, simple, fast and reliable desktop, which
would be  functional  in  modern  multi-tasking  environments and  all
flavours  and versions of  TOS-compatible  operating   system(s),  yet
retaining,  as much  as possible,  familiarity  with  the original TOS
desktop.

TeraDesk is NOT intended  to be a direct replacement for the excellent
but  resource-demanding desktops like  Thing or Jinnee, but instead is
designed to be used where disk space, system memory, speed limitations
or price make the use of those fine desktops impractical. For example,
TeraDesk's size and memory usage is currently only about 1/3 to 1/2 of
Jinnee's in a similar setup.

TeraDesk  was  initially  developed  by  Wout Klaren. Version 1.41 was
released in 1994, and here development stopped for some time.

Version  1.42 was the first version published under the General Public
License in 2002.

Version 2.0 was an adaptation by Henk Robbers to modern AESes, such as
N.AES,  XaAES and MagiC, near the end of 2002.

Version 2.3  was the first result of the joint efforts of Henk Robbers
and Djordje Vukovic, and comprised a number of new features.

Version  3.0  was the result of the continued cooperation of H.Robbers
and   Dj.Vukovic;  further  significant  improvements  to   TeraDesk's
functionality  were  made,   with  the  program  having  undergone  an
extensive redesign.

After Version 3.0 development has been continued mostly by Dj.Vukovic.

Since version 4.04 a Coldfire-compatible binary can be built using the
AHCC compiler developed by H. Robbers.

This program with its accompanying files is  Freeware and Open Source.
It may  be  copied  and distributed freely provided  that the terms of
the  GNU General Public License  (GPL; see  accompanying file COPYING)
are respected. If the program is distributed by a PD library, only the
costs of the disk and distribution may be recovered.

Tera Desktop files (included in the binary distribution) are:

@{U}1.2.1  Hardware requirements                                  TeraDesk@{u}

Tera Desktop  can be  used on any Atari ST series  computer  and their
offspring, TT, Falcon, Hades, Milan or emulators. It uses about 200 to
300 KB of memory (depending on the complexity of the configuration).

Since Version 4.04 a Coldfire-specific version exists as well.

TT-RAM or Alt-RAM, if installed, is recognised and used by TeraDesk.

Although Tera Desktop can be  run without the aid of a hard disk,  the
use of one is strongly recommended. Tera Desktop is not well optimised
(file operations-wise)  for use  on single  floppy-drive only systems.
File copying in TeraDesk is performed file-by-file, which when copying
files from one floppy disk to another on a machine  with a single disk
drive can mean a lot of disk swapping.

On machines without a hard disk but with enough memory,  a reset-proof
RAM-disk  can be used  to contain  TeraDesk files,  which may speed up
startup considerably.

Tera Desktop has not been tested with ROM-port cartridges  that behave
as drive 'c' (lowercase C).  It can be expected  that  such a  'drive'
will not be recognised, or that other problems may occur.

@{U}1.2.2 TOS version compatibility                               TeraDesk@{u}

Tera Desktop  should work with all existing versions of TOS, but it is
very  much  more  useful  with  versions  1.04 (also known as 1.4) and
above. There are several reasons for this, because in TOS version 1.04
and above:

- Folders can be renamed.

- The  file processing routines are  very much  better and enable more
facilities to be used.

- GEM  programs   (including  Tera Desktop  itself)   can  be  started
automatically after booting.

- There are significant bugs in TOS 1.0 and TOS 1.02 (1.2)

- Functionality  of  Tera Desktop is reduced  with  TOS versions older
than 1.04 (1.4) because of limitations on the size of menus.

Since Version 2  TeraDesk runs in modern  multi-tasking  environments,
such as  MagiC,  TOS with Geneva,  MiNT with N.AES,  XaAES,  MyAES  or
Atari AES 4.1. It can be run with memory protection;  however, in such
environments  problems  may  occur  with  some  incorrectly-programmed
or set AV-protocol clients  which can cause  TeraDesk to crash  if run
with memory protection. See The AV Protocol.

Versions of TOS that are not  multi-tasking-capable are often referred
to in this manual as 'single-TOS'.

TeraDesk 3* was tested on a number of system configurations, including
(but not limited to):

TOS 1.00 (RAM-loaded)

TOS 1.02 + MiNT 1.15.12 + AES 4.1 / N.Aes

TOS 1.04
TOS 1.04 (RAM-loaded)
TOS 1.04 + NVDI 2.0
TOS 1.04 + MiNT 1.15.12 + AES 4.1 / N.Aes

TOS 2.06 + Geneva 4 / 6 + NVDI 4.11
TOS 2.06 + MiNT 1.15.12 + NVDI 4.11 + AES 4.1 / N.Aes / MyAES
TOS 2.06 + MiNT 1.17.0  + NVDI 4.11 + AES 4.1 / N.Aes / XaAES / MyAES

TOS 3.05 + NVDI 2.0
TOS 3.06

Hades TOS 3.06 + oVDI
Hades TOS 3.06 + MiNT 1.16 + oVDI + N.Aes / XaAES

TOS 4.04
TOS 4.04 + MiNT 1.16 + AES 4.1 / N.Aes / XaAES / MyAES

Milan TOS 4.09 + MiNT 1.15.12 + N.Aes / XaAES

KAOS TOS

MagiC 6.0 + NVDI 5.0
MagiC 6.1 + NVDI 4.11
MagiC 6.2 + NVDI 4.11

The program should work  (with some restrictions) on TOS 1.0, but more
recent versions  of Tera Desktop  were  not tested thoroughly with it.
The possibility of  encountering  hitherto  undetected  problems  with
this TOS version can not be excluded, but please report such problems.

Tera Desktop may fail  on versions of  MiNT or MagiC  previous to 1.12
and 3.0 respectively.

A  problem  was encountered  related  to  mouse clicks on  the desktop
icons  when  TeraDesk  was  running in TOS 2.06 (only). An attempt has
been made to cure this, but it is  not yet sure whether  this has been
completely successful. A similar problem may exist in TOS 3.06.

Changing  screen  resolution works with  varying success  in different
AESes  (generally  supported with  AES 4 versions only), e.g. in TOS +
Geneva  or  TOS (+ MiNT) + AES4.1  it works  perfectly;  in some other
environments it doesn't work so well, or at all.

TeraDesk makes  several inquires  to try  to  determine  TOS- and AES-
versions, their  capabilities and limitations. If a version of TOS  or
AES  is not able  to answer  these questions,  TeraDesk tries  to make
guesses  that may  not always be correct.  It is also possible that an
incorrect answer to an inquiry  is supplied  by TOS/AES.  In that case
TeraDesk  may  work  with  unnecessary  limitations,  or else  try  to
activate features which may not work.

If TeraDesk is used with the new AESes  currently being developed (e.g
XaAES or MyAES), occasional unwanted behaviour  may occur  due to some
features of these AESes that are not yet fully functional. Such issues
are usually resolved with new releases of the AESes.

If TeraDesk is used  on an emulator,  some of its functionality may be
lost because of sometimes incomplete emulation. Such cases may include
e.g.  not recognising  certain  keyboard key codes,  not being able to
show directories in 'unsorted' order,  or encountering strange file or
directory owner IDs and file protection states.

Users should be aware that the current version of Tera Desktop has the
limitation that the number of items  in a directory,  or the number of
selected items in  a directory tree should not exceed 32767,  and that
the total size of all items in a directory (not counting  the sizes of
objects in subdirectories)  or of all objects included  in a selection
should not exceed 2047 GB (2 TB). The maximum disk partition size that
can be  correctly displayed is one billion clusters, which is at least
1 TB;  there are some provisions in the code  to increase those limits
to 2 EB in the future.  Maximum permitted  size of one individual file
is 2 GB.

@{U}1.2.3 Supported screen resolutions                            TeraDesk@{u}

Tera Desktop can work in any  screen resolution,  from  320x200 pixels
(ST-Low resolution mode upwards),  but it is recommended  that you use
it in  a higher resolution.  When used  in low resolution (ST-Low), it
may work with some  restrictions  depending  on the TOS version.  This
is due to  the limitation,  imposed by  older versions of the  AES, on
the size of menus  (small screen buffer size). This limitation  is met
by removing  some  menu items  when  insufficient  screen buffer  size
is detected  (this should never happen  EXCEPT in ST-Low and ST-Medium
resolutions):

- In TOS 1.04 and older, menu separator bars are removed;

- In TOS 1.02 and older, some menu items are removed, i.e:

       -Delete...
       -Print...
       -View unsorted
       -Reverse order
       -Copy disk...
       -Show size
       -Show date
       -Show time
       -Show attributes
       -Set program types...
       -Window options...
       -Video options...
       -Save settings as...

Configuration items usually set by removed menu items may still be set
in the configuration file. These  options are also still available via
Keyboard shortcuts. See also  Desk preferences...

In ST-High resolution  there should never be problems  related to menu
size in any older TOS version. See also  TOS version compatibility.

Another problem that may  be encountered when running  Tera Desktop in
a low screen resolution (like ST-Low) is that  some AESes (e.g. XaAES)
do not have certain graphic objects (e.g. radio buttons) optimised for
such video  modes,  which  may result  in  overlapping or badly  drawn
screen objects.  In such cases,  the appearance of  dialog elements in
Tera Desktop  can  be modified  through  the  use of  the  environment
variable TERAENV. See  Rendering of dialog objects.

If the resource file of  TeraDesk is  translated  to a  language other 
than English,  the translator should endavour to keep the dialog sizes
small enough to be used in ST-low video mode.  Unfortunately, this may
not be possible with some languages.

If TeraDesk is to be  used exclusively in  high screen resolutions and
a long-file-names-capable  environment, dialog sizes can be increased.
In such case,  the lengths  of the  scrollable  filename and  pathname 
fields (see Scrolled text fields) and  the search string field  can be
increased  in  the  dialogs.  TeraDesk uses these fields in such a way
that it is  safe to  use a resource editor and  increase the widths of
the  relevant  dialogs  and  scrollable  fields,  until  they suit the
user's aesthetic and other requirements. Note that the length of other
alphanumeric editable fields (e.g. name masks) should NOT be changed.

The  screen  resolution and  the number of  available  colours  can be
changed,  together   with  some   other  video-mode  related  options,
depending on  the  hardware,  AES and TOS  version used,  through  the
Video options...  dialog.  This feature  does not  work in some AESes,
though; generally, it is effective only with some versions of AES 4.

@{U}1.3  Some TeraDesk-specific Features                          TeraDesk@{u}

In an effort to make Tera Desktop  more comfortable and easy to use,
several features not present in some other desktops were introduced. 
In no particular order, some of those features are:

- Keyboard shortcuts  for all items  in the menu  can be  redefined.
  See Keyboard shortcuts
  
- Complex name masks  (inclusive, exclusive, with various wildcards)
  can be set for  Directory windows and document types for installed
  applications. See Set mask...
    
- Desktop icons  and / or symbolic links  can be created for network
  objects defined by  http://, ftp://, mailto://, etc. URLs and such
  objects can be set as 'document types' for installed applications.
  See Symbolic Links  Set desk icons...  Set applications...

- The file selector  can be opened  upon  pressing a key in order to
  insert a filename or a foldername into editable fields in dialogs.
  This feature can be used  to effectively add  the  fileselector to
  any TTP program. See Open...
  
- Copy operations in  'Update' and 'Restore' modes can be performed.
  See Dragging Objects  
  
- Sizes of large disk partitions and files are correctly  displayed.
  See Info...  Directory windows
  
- Floppy disks can be formatted in standard and nonstandard formats. 
  See Format disk... 
  
- More than one application can be associated  with a document type.
  See Set applications...
  
- Documents not assigned  to an application  can be opened selecting
  among  (installed) applications  and the  association  can be made
  permanent. See Open...
  
- Applications  can be  assigned  to  a number of  'special uses' in
  order to  enhance  or replace  Tera Desktop's  internal  routines. 
  See Special Applications
  
- Among 'special uses' for  installed applications  is an assignment
  to the right mouse button which can be used to elegantly  interact
  with e.g. a taskbar, an external viewer or a file-copying program. 
  See Special Applications

- File contents can be compared. See Compare...

- A system-wide font selector exists,  usable by other applications.
  See The font selector dialog
  
- Files not associated with applications can be displayed in text or
  hex mode using the built-in viewer. See Text windows

Although  TeraDesk  has been tested extensively, the program may still
contain bugs.  It is  also possible  that  the program  will  not work
properly  on  configurations  other  than  the  configurations  it has
been tested with (see TOS version compatibility).

THE  AUTHORS  DISCLAIM  ALL  RESPONSIBILITY  FOR  ANY  LOSS  OR DAMAGE

@{U}2  Installation                                               TeraDesk@{u}

Tera Desktop should be installed as follows:

1. Create  a  folder called e.g. DESKTOP or TERADESK  anywhere on your
floppy or hard disk (or in a RAM disk) to hold the Tera Desktop files.
It is also possible,  although a little untidy,  to put them  into the
root directory of a disk volume.

2. Copy into this folder the files:

       DESKTOP.PRG  (if  you  intend  to use multi-tasking)  OR
       DESKTOS.PRG  (if you  will  work  in  single-TOS  ONLY) OR
       DESK_CF.PRG  (if you need a Coldfire-specific version)
       DESKTOP.RSC
       ICONS.RSC    (if you will use monochrome icons) AND/OR
       CICONS.RSC   (ONLY if your AES can support colour icons)

Note  that  DESKTOP.PRG  will work in single-TOS as well;  DESKTOS.PRG
just  saves  a  few kilobytes of memory  by not containing  code which
is not relevant in  single-TOS environment,  and by  having a somewhat
limited support for The AV Protocol  (AV-protocol functions not likely
to be used in  single-TOS  are removed).  Beware that  the  single-TOS
version may not properly interpret some configuration files created by
the  multi-tasking  version, e.g. if they  contain  any  references to
Symbolic Links or long file names.

If only DESKTOS.PRG is  to be used  it may be  renamed to  DESKTOP.PRG
after copying,  but this  is not required.  The program will  register
itself with the AES as "DESKTOP" anyway.

On a Coldfire system, the DESK_CF.PRG  program  should be used instead
of DESKTOP.PRG. Same as with DESKTOS.PRG the program can be renamed to
DESKTOP.PRG but this is not required.

The Coldfire-specific  version should be compatible with  MC68020  and
higher processors as well.

You can  (but need not) also copy  into this folder  the configuration
files TERADESK.INF and  TERADESK.PAL  from the  \EXAMPLES folder. Note
that these files are set  for a hypothetical  computer  configuration,
and may not  be appropriate for your setup  (Tera Desktop will attempt
to  obey all that is  specified  in the configuration file,  no matter
what the  actual  environment is,  e.g. the example  TERADESK.INF  has
desktop icon for drives  A, B and C only,  and, if  that file is used,
only those disk icons will be shown on the desktop).

If you start  Tera Desktop without  TERADESK.INF in its directory, the
program will complain  that it can not find its configuration file. In
order to avoid this message appearing again,  activate "Save settings"
in the Options menu.  Of course, before saving,  the configuration can
first  be set  to  any  user's  particular  environment  and  taste by
defining additional desktop and window icons, filetypes, etc.

If you would feel more comfortable with  Tera Desktop  translated into
some other language, you can replace DESKTOP.RSC  (and maybe ICONS.RSC
and  CICONS.RSC)  with  translated files.  All text  strings  used  by
Tera Desktop are located in DESKTOP.RSC,  except default filenames and
a warning that DESKTOP.RSC can not be found.  It is  thus possible  to
completely  adapt Tera Desktop  to other languages by using translated
resource files.  Check the links on TeraDesk's  webpage  for currently
available translations, or make one yourself, using a resource editor.

3. If you  use ST-Guide  or other  compatible  hypertext viewer,  copy
TERADESK.HYP and TERADESK.REF from the \DOC folder to the folder where
your other .HYP files are.  When you first start Tera Desktop, install
your hypertext viewer  (program or accessory)  as the  application for
the  *.HYP filetype and save the configuration.  The  hypertext manual
for  TeraDesk will  thereafter  be  available  with the  [Shift][Help]
keypress.  If you  would like  to have a  translated  hypertext manual
instead,  check  the  links  on  Tera Desktop's   home  web  page  for
currently available translations, and replace the English TERADESK.HYP
and TERADESK.REF with translated ones, if they exist.

After copying the necessary files, Tera Desktop can now  be started in
the usual way by double-clicking on its name.

4. Tera Desktop's cooperation  with  some  other applications  will be
improved if it is announced  that certain protocols can be handled. In
order to do so, the following environment variables can be defined:

 AVSERVER=DESKTOP
 FONTSELECT=DESKTOP

These declare  TeraDesk as the AV-Server (see The AV Protocol)  and as
the font-selector (see The FONT Protocol). In single-TOS configuration
these protocols can be used by some accessories (such as ST-Guide); in
multi-tasking configurations they can be used  by concurrently running
applications. See also  Supported Protocols.

How environment variables are declared  depends on the variants of the
OS and utilities used.

5. It is convenient  to have TeraDesk  start automatically  at  system
boot. If you have TOS version 1.04 (also known as TOS 1.4)  or higher,
you can  set this up  by  installing TeraDesk  as  an application, and
changing its boot status from 'Normal' to 'Auto'. Remember to save the
desktop configuration after this. From now on, TeraDesk will take over
all desktop tasks. Before saving the desktop configuration,  all other
applications  should  be deinstalled,  all unneeded icons removed from
the  desktop,  and  all  unnecessary  windows  closed.  This  is   not
absolutely   required,  but   will  reduce  the  size  of  DESKTOP.INF
(or NEWDESK.INF), and also free some memory.

If  you  have  TOS version 1.0 or 1.02  you must use a program such as
STARTGEM to run DESKTOP from an AUTO folder.

If  you  use  Atari  AES 4.1,  you  can  put  something similar to the
following directive into your GEM.CNF file:

 shell path\to\TeraDesk\desktop.prg

Then,  the  built-in desktop of AES 4.1 will not be loaded at startup,
and  TeraDesk  will run  as the  desktop  instead.  Besides being more
elegant than manual startup,  this  also  saves  some  memory.

If you use Geneva, N.AES, XaAES or MyAES,  you should in a similar way
specify TeraDesk as the default shell in the appropriate places in the
configuration  files  of these  AESes  (i.e. in   GEM.CNF,  N_AES.CNF,
XAAES.CNF and MYAES.CNF respectively).  See the documentation  for the
relevant AES.

If  you  use  MagiC,  TeraDesk  should be specified as a shell via the
#_SHL directive in MAGX.INF, as something like this:

 #_SHL PATH\TO\TERADESK\DESKTOP.PRG

Note that in the case  of a severe crash,  MagiC will not restart with
the shell specified in this directive,  but will use its default shell
(MagXDesk) instead. This is hard-coded into MagiC,  and can be changed
only by editing MAGIC.RAM.

6. Some versions of AES (e.g. Geneva 4) declare themselves  as capable
of handling colour icons, but some colour icons fail to work with Tera
Desktop. In such cases,  if the problematic icons can not be replaced,  
the CICONS.RSC resource file should be removed, and TeraDesk will fall
back to using monochrome icons.  Colour icons file can also be removed
in other cases when there is a need to preserve as much free memory as
possible.

7. The icon files  supplied  contain  basic icon sets only.  Users are
encouraged to create  their own, more extensive, icon files.  They can
add icons at will to the existing files,  or use other icon files (for
example, one can rename DESKICON.RSC and/or  DESKCICN.RSC, used by the
built-in desktop of TOS, to ICONS.RSC and CICONS.RSC respectively, and
use them with  TeraDesk. Any files used  should contain  certain icons
essential to TeraDesk - see below).

TeraDesk, since  V2.0, handles icons by name, not by index. Icons with
the following names (or their translated equivalents) should always be
present in the icons resource file(s):

 FLOPPY, HARD DISC, TRASH, PRINTER, FOLDER, FILE, APP

See also  The icons files.

8. Some aspects of Tera Desktop's  behaviour can be  (or may be in the
future) controlled  through the  environment variable TERAENV,  mostly
because they have to be set before any Configuration Files are loaded.
The value  of  the  TERAENV  variable  should  consist  of  uppercase-
letter flags. Currently, only flags 'A' and 'D' can be used, as in:

 TERAENV=A   or  TERAENV=D   or TERAENV=AD

which to some extent control  the implementation of the  ARGV protocol
and the visual appearance  of dialog objects  respectively. If TERAENV
is NOT defined, Tera Desktop will work normally.

Note that this variable is evaluated only when TeraDesk starts.  Later
changes to TERAENV will have no effect.

9. Users are advised to load,  check and save  any existing TeraDesk's
Configuration Files.  As the format  of configuration files may change
slightly with new releases,  following this procedure will ensure that
they will be kept up to date as much as possible.

@{U}3.1  Conventions                                              TeraDesk@{u}

1. It  is assumed that the reader knows  how to use the standard Atari
desktop as described  in the  user manual supplied  with the computer.
Tera Desktop attempts to follow, within reason, the conventions set by
the built-in TOS desktop.

2. The  procedure of 'Selecting' an object will often be mentioned. By
this is meant  the act of placing the mouse on the object and clicking
the  left button  once.  The display  of the Object  should  change to
reverse  video, or, if the object is represented by an animated colour
icon,  to the 'selected' form of the icon. Many icons and some objects
in  dialog  boxes can also be selected by pressing certain keys or key
combinations.

If you select  more objects  while the first  is still  selected,  the
first is deselected  -  UNLESS  you  held  down the [Shift]  key while
selecting them; in that way you can select several objects.

Another way of selecting several objects at once is to place the mouse
arrow  to the left  of one  of them and then  hold down the left mouse
button.  Then, if you move the mouse, a 'rubberbox' will form in which
you can enclose other objects. When you release  the mouse button, all
the  enclosed  objects  are selected. Note that all the objects in the
box are selected, even though not all are visible. This is relevant if
you scroll the contents of a window at the same time.

Objects in a topped  directory window  can also be selected  using the
@{autoselector link "Directory windows"}: as the user starts  typing a string of characters on the
keyboard,  all directory items  with names  conforming to  the pattern
<typed characters>*.* or  (depending on context)  <typed characters>.*
or <typed characters>* are automatically selected in the window.

3. We shall also refer to 'Opening' a file.  This generally means that
you  place  the  mouse  cursor on the file (in a directory) and double
click with  the left mouse button.  Instead of a double click with the
left button,  a single click  with the right mouse button  can be made
(except if an installed application has been marked for special use as
'Right button extension'- see Special Applications). Files can also be
opened by first selecting them,   and then selecting  Open... from the
@{File link "Menu title: File"} menu.

4. We  shall  refer to keys  with square brackets enclosing the symbol
written on the key itself. e.g. [Return], [Q] etc.

5. Sometimes we mention 'masks'.  A  mask  is a sequence of characters
which may or may not match a filename. Beside the the standard symbols
that  may appear in a filename,  masks may contain the symbols '*' and
'?', and also  additional specifications like  [<chars>] and  !<char>.
All these serve to specify ranges of filenames, e.g:

 - '*' stands for  any character  or run  of zero  or more  characters
   so that A*B matches AB, AAB, ACB, AAAB, ACCB, ABCB etc.  A* matches
   A, AB,AAA,ABC,ABCD etc.

 - '?' stands for any single character: A?B matches AAB, ACB, A B etc.

In single-TOS, the default catch-all mask is usually '*.*';  in multi-
tasking environments with  looser restrictions on names  it is usually
just '*'. See also  Set mask...

6. Most menu items  and dialog buttons can be selected with a keyboard
key (or key combination) as well as with the mouse.

@{U}3.2  Types of program files                                   TeraDesk@{u}

Several types of programs (applications) can be encountered.

The  type  of  a  given  program  depends  on how it is written and is
beyond  your control;  usually  the type of a program  is indicated by
its extension but, be warned, this is not always so.

The types are:

             Type  Usual       Description
                   extensions

        1.   GEM   .PRG, .APP  Program uses GEM and does not require
                               parameters.

        2.   GTP   .GTP        Program   uses   GEM   and   requires
                               parameters;  the GTP extension is not
                               recognised  in older versions  of the
                               built-in desktop.

        3.   TOS   .TOS        Program does not use GEM and does not
                               require parameters.

        4.   TTP   .TTP        Program does not use GEM but requires
                               parameters.

        5.   ACC   .ACC        Accessory program.

Parameters are items of data,  often file names,  that are sent to the
program as you invoke it.

A desktop program recognizes these program types from  their extension
and reacts appropriately when you open them. With TTP and GTP programs
it displays a dialog box in which you can enter command parameters.

While it is possible  to rename program files giving them an extension
that  does  not  properly  reflect  their  type,  this is inadvisable.
Nevertheless  Tera Desktop  will  allow  you  to define  the type of a
program.

Thus,  If  a  GEM  or  TOS type program file is given the .GTP or .TTP
extension, anything you enter  in the parameter dialog box is ignored.
Conversely,  a GTP or TTP type program that has not been provided with
the parameters it expects may not work properly.

@{U}3.3  Running a program                                        TeraDesk@{u}

There  are  several  ways  in  which  you  can invoke (run, execute) a
program both from the standard desktop and from Tera Desktop.

1.  Perhaps the most common method of starting a program is to open it
by double clicking on its name or icon in one of  Directory windows. A
parameter dialog box is displayed for GTP and TTP files.

2.  Another method is to set up an icon for the program on the desktop
so that it is started when you double click on it.

3.  The third method  is to install the program as an application, and
to set up a function key (in the  Set applications...  dialog) so that
the program is started when the key is pressed.

4.  The fourth  method is to install the program as an application and
to set it as 'boot' or (in TeraDesk) as 'autostart';  in TeraDesk, all
programs  so  marked  will be automatically started sequentially after
TeraDesk is started (see Set applications...).

5.  Yet   another  method  is  to   double  click   on  an  associated
'Application  Document' file (see Set applications...). The program is
started  and  the  name  of  the  application  document is passed as a
parameter.

6.  Finally,  you can  drag  an application document  (see above) to a
program  icon.  As  long as the application document file name matches
one  of  the program's application masks (see Set applications...), it
will be as if you had double clicked on the file as in method 5.

Note  that  Accessory  programs  cannot be started from the desktop in
single-TOS  in  any  of  these  ways;  they  can  only  be  started at
boot time and activated by selecting their appropriate menu item.

However, it makes sense in single-TOS to install  an accessory program
as the application  for some document types,  if that  accessory knows
of VA_START message (see The AV Protocol), and if the desktop can send
this message.  Such an application is  e.g. ST-Guide  (when run as  an
accessory),  which may be  installed  as the application  for the .HYP
files.

In a multi-tasking environment a question arises of  whether or not to
start multiple instances of the same program/application. Tera Desktop
resolves this issue in the following way:

- If the selected program is not running, it is, of course, started.

- If the selected program/application  is already running, then:
  . If a document is selected, as in methods #5 and #6 above, its name
    is always sent to the already-running application.
  . In all other cases,  and also if a document  has been dragged to a
    program icon (as in method #6 above) while holding the [Alternate]
    key pressed, Tera Desktop asks  whether to start  another instance
    of the same application.  If a confirmatory response  is given,  a
    new instance of the application will be started and any parameters
    present  will be sent to it.  If a negative response is given, any
    parameters existing will be passed to the running application.

@{U}4.2.1  Open...                                                TeraDesk@{u}

With  this action,  one  or more  selected objects  can be opened. The
meaning of the term depends on the type of the selected objects.

If  the selected object  is a  disk volume  or  a folder,  a directory
window is opened on that object. If  more than one object of this type
is selected, each is opened in a new window.

If the object  is an executable file (program), it is started  (or the
command line parameters  are sent to an  already-running  program; see
Running a program). If more than one object is selected,  and TeraDesk
operates in single-TOS,  no more items will be opened  after a program
is started.  In a  multi-tasking  environment  there  is a  delay of a
couple  of seconds  between each program being started,  to allow  the
program to configure itself, shrink used memory, etc.

If  the object is a file,  and that  filetype  has been  assigned as a
document type to an application,  that application is started, and the
selected file is opened, as above.  If the document  has been assigned
to more than one application, a dialog is opened  showing the assigned
applications and permitting  the user to select  among one of them. If
the selected application is already running,  an attempt is first made
to send the filename  to that application  using the  VA_START message
(see The AV Protocol).

If the object is a symbolic link,  it is always followed to the target
object,  and the action  appropriate  for the target is commenced,  as
above (see Symbolic Links).

If network objects  such as web pages and  ftp sites  are  assigned as
'document types' to applications, they can be opened from this dialog.
Such objects should  have names  beginning  with one  of the following
prefixes: http:, https:, ftp: or mailto:. See Set applications...

If the object is neither a program  nor a file that has been  assigned
to an application, a dialog with opening options is displayed:

- Selecting 'Show' opens a Text window with the selected file.  If the
  file is not suitable for being  displayed as text,  its hex-dump can
  be shown.

- Selecting 'Edit' calls an editor (if it has been installed)  to open
  the file.

- Selecting 'Run' causes the file to be treated as an executable file,
  although such filetype has not been marked as a program type  in the
  Set program options...  dialog.  The program type dialog  appears in
  which a program type can be set for the selected file (assignment is
  not permanent). The file is then opened (started) as a program.

- Selecting 'With' opens The listbox dialog from which  an application
  can  be  selected  to open  the file  with.  Selection  can  be made
  either  by single-clicking  upon an application  in the listbox, and
  then by clicking 'OK' or by double-clicking upon  an application, in
  which case the dialog is immediately closed.  If the  setup for  the
  selected  application  is edited,  the  object's name or type can be
  assigned as a documenttype for this application  (object's name will
  be preset in the dialog),  in which case this  file type will in the
  future  always  be opened  with  the chosen application.

The dialog  with opening options also appears if  an object is  opened
while holding the [Alternate] key pressed.

If no objects  are  selected,  a dialog opens  in  which  the path and
name of  the object can be  entered in the  '@{"scrolled editable field" link "Scrolled text fields"}'.
TeraDesk tries to divine the type of the item  so  specified:  a file,
a folder, an application or a document assigned to an application, and
acts  accordingly,  as above.  If an application is  specified  in the
dialog, its name can be followed by a command tail (separated from the
name by at least one space character).

If [Insert] key is pressed  while the cursor is  in the editable field
in this dialog,  the file selector will appear that can help in making
a selection. A double click by mouse has the same effect.

Name of the last object opened and the trailing command  are preserved
in the dialog (i.e. between calls), until another application has been
activated.

If the  object name  or  any of  the parameters  in  the  command line
contains spaces,  that name/parameter should be entered between a pair
of single  or  double quotes  (the ' or "  characters).  If a  command
line is to contain the quote character,  two consecutive quotes should
be entered.

When  this  item  is selected, Tera Desktop displays information about
the directory  (or desktop)  object  (or objects)  that  are currently
selected:

1. If the selected object is a file, its name, path, the time and date
when it was last modified,  and its size is displayed.  If the file or
filetype  has been  associated  with an application,  the name  of the
application  is displayed.  If the object  is recognized  as a program
(executable) file, the state of its header flags is displayed.

The name of the file, its access date and time can be changed. You can
also   set/unset   the  Write  Protect,  Archive,  Hidden  and  System
attributes   of  the  file.  If  the  file  is  write-protected,  this
attribute  must be reset before attempting to change other information
related to that file. If time and date fields are cleared, the current
system time and date will be set for the file.

If the  selected object  resides on an ext2 or  other  Unix filesystem
partition,  user  access rights  and  user/group  IDs  are  shown  and
settable instead of FAT file attributes. In this case, a set of twelve
checkboxes appears, permitting the user to set read, write and execute
rights, as well as the special flags  (Sticky, SetGID, SetUID) for the
world, group and user (owner) respectively. User (owner) and group IDs
are also shown and can be set.

Note 1: The  state of SetGID and SetUID flags  should be changed  with
extreme caution. See the documentation for the Fchmod() function.

Note 2: Setting of user access rights and user/group IDs  may silently
fail when attempted on some (not all)  network file systems that  have
user-id-mapping activated. 

2. If the selected object is a folder, its name, the time  and date of
its creation, the number of files and folders in it, and the number of
bytes used  will be displayed.  Folder attributes  (Readonly, Archive,
Hidden and System) are also displayed, although they are not  settable
in TOS. The  attributes  may  however  be set  e.g.  on a  floppy disk
manipulated  in  Windows  on  a  PC.  On Unix filesystems,  partitions
access  rights  are shown  instead of  FAT attributes, the same as for
files.

With TOS version 1.04 and above, the folder name can be changed.

3. If the selected object is a symbolic link, its  name, the time  and
date of creation  and its size will be displayed.  File attributes are
also  displayed,  but changing  them will  NOT affect the link itself.
The path and name of the object  the link is referencing is displayed,
and it can be edited. Note that if this item is changed, the  symbolic
link will in fact be deleted and a new one created.

4. If  the  selected  object  is  a disk volume, the drive letter, the
volume label, the numbers of used and  available bytes, the total free
space on it,  and the  cluster size  will be displayed. If the disk is
empty it is possible  that the total space  and the free space will be
different; this is caused by a bug in TOS.  

If the button  'More' is pressed,  the numbers of  files (or files and
links) and folders  on the volume  will  be displayed.  Note that on a
large volume this counting may take some time.

5.  If  no  object  has  been  selected,  Tera Desktop   will  display
information  on the disk volume of the top directory window, if any is
open, or  on the text file in the top  text window if any  is open. If
there are no open windows, this menu item is disabled.

If the selected object is  larger than 9999999 bytes, its size will be
shown in kilobytes  (1 KB = 1024 B)  or megabytes  (1 MB = 1048576 B),
not in bytes; if the size is not  an exact multiple of  the unit used,
it will be rounded  to the larger value.  If the object is larger than
2 TB  (or one billion clusters,  if the object  is a  disk partition),
TeraDesk will not correctly display its size.

Users should remember  that the  current  version of TeraDesk  can not 
correctly  display  information  about  a folder  or a  disk partition
containing more than 32767 files. See TOS version compatibility.


It is  possible  to select  more than one object  before invoking this
menu  item;  the content of the  dialog box will change to show fields
appropriate for the selected item types in turn.

Selecting  'All' will cause setting of file attributes and/or date and
time   on   all  selected  file  items.  Selecting  this  button  when
information  on  a  folder is shown will cause setting  of attributes,
date  and time on all files  in the folder and its subfolders, but the
data for the folders themselves  will not be affected.  This action is
confirmed  by  the  appearance  of   a  dialog  in which  the user can
select  whether  only file attributes should be set, or time and date,
or both.

Selecting  'OK'  will  cause  setting  of  all  displayed data for the
currently displayed item.

Selecting  'Skip'  will  cancel  all  changes  made  for the currently
displayed item and show the next selected item.

Selecting  'Abort'  will  cause closing the dialog and cancellation of
all changes.

The Info... dialog  can also  appear  on  the  screen  as a  result of
the Format disk...  operation (to show  the configuration of the newly
formatted floppy disk) and also as a result of the Search... operation
(to found show item(s)  that  match the search criteria); in this last
case  the dialog  may contain  additional data  showing the results of
the string search in the shown file.

Note that the latter option  will be enabled only  if the  file system
and the operating system support Symbolic Links.

When creating symbolic links, TeraDesk will offer  a name for the link
in the form: Link_to_<selected object name>; the user can edit this to
his liking (also, on some filesystems the length of this name may have
to be limited).  The name of  the referenced object will  be displayed
and editable too.

Tera Desktop  has the capability  to compare  contents of files.  When
this menu  item  is selected,  a dialog appears  in which the user can
enter the names of two  files to  be  compared. If  this  menu item is
selected  when  either  one  or  two files  are  already  selected  in
Directory windows,  the names of those files will  be entered into the
dialog automatically.

If the [Insert] key is pressed  while the cursor is in any  of the two
fields in this dialog, the file selector will appear which can help in
entering the filenames. A double click by mouse has the same effect.

Clicking 'OK' in the dialog starts the comparison.  When a  difference
between the contents  of  the  two  files  is  detected,  the contents
of both files near  the detected difference is displayed in the dialog
as well as the offset  of  the found  difference from the start of the
first file.  Note that  instead  of any  'null' characters,  the <DEL>
character, usually represented  by a small triangle, will be used as a
substitution.

File   comparison   function   tries  to  use  some  intelligence  and
resynchronize further comparison  in  the files  after a difference is
found.  The width of the resynchronization window  can be  entered  in
the dialog, in the range of  1 to 99 characters.  Smaller window sizes
will set Tera Desktop to detect  small  differences  closely following
each other.  Larger window sizes will set  Tera Desktop to  treat such
cases as a  single difference and to  resynchronize  comparison  after
skipping  a complete  block  of  small differences. It is  recommended
that window width be set  not larger  than  the  length  of  the field
where  the differences are  displayed  in the  dialog (30 characters),
so that complete differing segments can be viewed.

This  function completely reads both files into memory,  and may be of
limited use on machines with small RAM.

An installed application  can be set to perform  the compare function.
The application will  completely replace the built-in compare function
and its dialog in TeraDesk. See Set applications...

@{U}4.2.5   Search...                                             TeraDesk@{u}

When this menu item is selected, a dialog  appears  in  which the name
pattern (name or name mask) to be searched for  in the selected files,
folders  and / or disk volumes is  specified. If no selection is made,
the search  will be  active  in the  top directory  window.  If a text
window is  topped  and  a string  is specified  for search, it will be
searched for in the file displayed in this text window.

A file/folder name  or name pattern (mask)  must always be  specified.
If it is not specified, search will not commence.

Date and size limits are optional; if left blank, TeraDesk will ignore
them.

String  to be  searched for  is optional.  If left blank, Tera Desktop 
will only search  for files and folders  having names  that  match the
name  pattern  mask.  If any string  is specified,  Tera Desktop  will 
search for it in the files that match the name pattern.

If a string is specified, the search can be modified  by selecting the
option to ignore character case when matching strings (this option may
not work  correctly  for 'national' characters with ASCII codes in the
128-255 range).

By default any search will involve all subdirectories of  the selected
directory or volume.  This can be modified  by selecting the option to
skip search in subfolders.

If either the size range or the string is specified, search is limited
to files only  (i.e. any directory names  matching the pattern will be
ignored).

If a match  is  found  the  Info...  dialog  is  opened   showing  the
specification of  the  found  object.  If  a  search  string  has been
entered, file contents surrounding the found string are displayed;  to
save  space, the  string itself  is replaced by [...]  so that more of
the  text preceding  and following  the string can be displayed.  Note
that some  characters  which  would  corrupt  the  formatting   of the
displayed  text  are replaced  by a substitute -  the <DEL> character,
which in most fonts is represented by a small triangle.

Note that each file searched for strings is first completely read into
memory.  Therefore, searching  for strings in  large files  may not be
possible,  depending on the amount of free memory.  If a search string
is not  specified,  search  will  involve  only file and folder names,
without actually reading any files, and memory will not be a limit.

Search operation can be interrupted by pressing the [Esc] key.

An installed application  can be set  to perform  the search function.
The  application will  completely replace the built-in search function
and its dialog in TeraDesk. See Set applications...

@{U}4.2.6  Print...                                               TeraDesk@{u}

If a printable file is selected, the file will be printed.

If  no  objects  are  selected,  a listing of the top window directory
will be printed.  Amount and order of  information  shown  will depend
on the   settings in the  'View'  menu  (it will be the same as on the
screen).

It is  possible  to select  more than  one object before invoking this
menu item.  All files will be printed in turn.  Printing order will be
the same as when viewed as 'Unsorted' in a directory window.

If a viewer window is topped, the file in this window will be printed.

You can modify the behaviour of the operation in the Copy and print...
options dialog.

If so set in the  Copy and print... dialog,  The copy info dialog  may
appear in which additional printing options may be set:

- Printing can be redirected to a file. If this option is checked, the
  file selector  will appear in order to  perimt the user  to select a
  print file. Default filename extension for the print file is .PRN.

- If files are printed, one of three printing modes can be selected:

  .Text mode: files printed  will be  considered  as text  files,  and
   carriage returns/line feeds  will  be  inserted  upon reaching  the
   specified  printer line length;  lines longer than this length will
   be wrapped.  If a file being printed  is recognized  as a  program,
   printing mode will be temporarily switched to hex-dump (see below).

  .Hex-dump: files will be printed formatted identically  as in a text
   window in hex mode.

  .Raw data: files will  be sent to the printer  as they are,  without
   any modification.  This mode is convenient for printing print-files
   created by applications.

In the current version of Tera Desktop,  all printing  is done through
GEMDOS, using the Cprnout() function.

If you are running Tera Desktop in low or medium screen resolution and
TOS 1.0, this menu item may not be visible because  of the limitations
of this  TOS version.  In that case it will be  available only through
Keyboard shortcuts.

The copy info dialog: if it is set,  both the selected  symbolic links
and the referenced objects will be deleted;  otherwise, only the links
will be deleted (option is available only in MiNT and MagiC).

When this menu item is selected while a floppy drive icon is selected,
a physical copy, sector by sector, of the floppy will be made.  Before
attempting  actual  copying, a check will be made to see if the target
and  the  source disk have the same format. Therefore, both disks must
have  valid  boot sectors  containing the information on the number of
sides, tracks  and sectors.  Beware that this  check may  prevent copy
of some specially formatted floppy disks without proper boot sectors.

If a sector-copy  operation fails,  it is retried  before  an error is
reported. Number of retries can be specified in the dialog.

A buffer of the size specified in the Copy and print... dialog will be
used for copying.

If  this  operation  is  used  in a multi-tasking environment (MiNT or
MagiC),  an attempt  is made  to lock the  floppy drive device  before
commencing copying.

If you are running Tera Desktop in low or medium screen resolution and
TOS 1.0, this menu item may not be visible  because of the limitations

@{U}4.2.10 Format disk...                                         TeraDesk@{u}

When this menu item is selected while a floppy drive icon is selected,
the dialog of the Floppy format function appears on the screen.

The dialog offers a number of formatting options:

- Four standard densities for 3.5" floppy disks:

    .Single sided    (SSDD -  360 KB)
    .Double sided    (DSDD -  720 KB)
    .High density    (DSHD - 1440 KB)
    .Extra density   (DSED - 2880 MB)
     
- Reformatting with existing format parameters read from the floppy.

- For each  format type chosen,  main parameters  can be  edited which
  modify the basic format  (parameters are editable only after a basic
  format had been selected, otherwise previous values are used):

    .number of sides
    .number of tracks
    .number of sectors per tracks
    .root directory size
    .volume label
    
- Number  of retries  to  attempt  before a  failed  sector-formatting
  operation is reported can be specified.
  
- Option to perform a 'quick format' is available. When it is selected
  only the  first two tracks of the floppy  will be reformatted. These
  tracks contain the boot sector, the FATs and the root directory. Use
  of this feature should be avoided  when numbers of tracks or sectors
  per track are set differently than in the previous format.
  
If the format operation  is used  in a multi-tasking environment (MiNT
or MagiC),  an attempt is made to lock the floppy drive device  before
commencing formatting.  If it fails  (e.g. if the device is already in
use), formatting will not start.

It should be noted that reformatting a floppy disk with the 'Previous'
format type does not necessarily  exactly reproduce the  original boot
sector.  Only the number of  disk sides,  number of tracks,  number of
sectors per track,  and root directory size  are read  from the floppy
disk and used.

Formatting can be interrupted by pressing the [Esc] key.

An installed application  can be set to  perform  the  formatting. The
application will completely replace  the built-in  formatting function
and its dialog in TeraDesk. See Set applications...

Upon selecting this menu item  a dialog  is displayed  in which one of
the options for quitting TeraDesk can be selected:

  1: Cancel the operation
  2: Return to the standard desktop or to the AES fallback desktop
  3: Reboot the computer
  4: Shut down the computer completely

If any option but  'Cancel'  is selected,  TeraDesk closes all windows
and signs-off all  AV-protocol  clients.  If 'Reboot' or 'Shutdown' is
selected TeraDesk than initiates a system shutdown.  Otherwise it just
quits.

Note  that  only  a  very  simple  sequence of  shutdown operations is
performed: TeraDesk  first calls  shel_write()  in full shutdown mode; 
after returning from  this function  and  waiting for 2 seconds  for a 
message to terminate,  it attempts Shutdown() either in halt/powerdown
or cold reboot mode  (depending on the selected option). If Shutdown()
has no effect, TeraDesk, depending on  the selected  shutdown  option,
either disables  some interrupts and  enters into  an endless loop, or
performs a reset.  If CT60 expansion is detected,  TeraDesk is able to
power it off at shutdown at the very end of shutdown sequence. 

If a  more  sophisticated  shutdown  is required, an external Shutdown
utility should be used. See Set applications...

When this option  is selected,  TeraDesk will  attempt to optimize the
use of the screen area  when displaying  Directory windows. This means
that:

- In text mode (see Show as icons) the directories may be displayed in
  one or more columns,  depending on  screen width  and the length  of
  directory lines,  which, in turn,  depends on  selection  of visible
  fields  (see Show options).  This option is  especially useful  when
  it  is needed  to display  as many items  in  a directory  window as
  possible.  Choice of a smaller font for directory windows  increases
  the number of columns that can be displayed on the screen.

- In icon mode the directories are displayed with  icons rearranged to
  fit the current  widths  of  the windows.  Horizontal  scrolling  of
  the windows is neither possible nor needed.

When this options is deselected:

- In text mode directories are displayed in one column only.

- In icon mode the  directories are displayed  with icons  arranged to
  fit the whole width of the screen. The horizontal slider can be used
  to scroll  the window to left or right in order to make  some of the
  items visible.

Note: it can be expected that window manipulation (scrolling, changing
size, etc.)  will be somewhat  slower  when  in text display mode  and
this option is selected. On the  contrary, when the display is in icon
mode,  window manipulation  may be  slower  when this  option is -not-
selected.

@{U}4.3.6  Set mask...                                            TeraDesk@{u}

With this  menu item, the user  select  which files  are shown  in the
current (top) directory  window.  A dialog box is displayed into which
you can either type a name mask (a pattern for object names which will
become visible in the window) or select a mask from a predefined list.

Double  clicking  on  a mask  in  the  list  has  the double effect of
selecting the mask and exiting the box as if you selected 'OK'.

It  is  also  possible  to delete the mask  that is selected,  edit an
existing mask, or add a new one to the list. See The listbox dialog.

The  selected  mask  ONLY  applies  to  the directory window  that was
current (topped) when this item was selected.  See also  Conventions.

Some characters have special meanings in name masks and enable them to
be used for ranges of object names.  Those characters (sometimes named
'wildcards') are:

   *                        - any string of characters
   ?                        - any single character
   !<char>                  - any single character but <char>
   [<char1><char2><...?>]   - any one of the <char1>, <char2>...

A complete filename can be specified  for the mask as well,  either by
entering it manually, or by selecting a name in a directory window and
then opening this dialog.

It is also possible to specify an exclusion mask: if a tilde character
'~' is prepended  to  a mask,  all  names  that  do  -not-  match  the
remaining of the mask string will be shown.

User should beware that, on a slow machine,  specifying a very complex
name mask may slow the opening of directories considerably. Also, some
masks do not make sense and  can not be  understood by TeraDesk:  e.g.
one should not use '!...' or '[...]' between '*' and another wildcard.

If a mask is not set for some  directory window, Tera Desktop will use
the default mask. In single-TOS,  the default catch-all mask is '*.*';
in multi-tasking environments with looser restrictions  on names it is
just '*'.  An explicitly set mask  for a directory window can be reset
to default  by clearing  the  editable  field  in the dialog  and then
clicking 'OK'.

In single-TOS, only the '*' and '?' wildcards are legal. However, Tera
Desktop permits the use of  '~', '!...' and '[...]' in single-TOS, but
within the constraint  that the 8+3  filename structure  of single-TOS
must be obeyed.

Besides the name mask, one can use the autoselector in order to locate
items in a directory window.  See also: Conventions  Directory windows

Alongside name masks,  four other  file masking options  relevant only 
for Directory windows can be set:

     Hidden              show hidden files
     System              show system files
     Subfolders          show subfolders
     Parent              show the '..' (parent) virtual folder

These selections are global, i.e. they apply to ALL Directory windows.

It should be noted that, if  Parent  option is set,  the Closer widget 
will always  completely close any directory window.  If this option is
disabled, the Closer widget will, if a window displays the contents of
a (sub)folder,  switch the  displayed directory to  that of the parent
folder.

This menu item is visible only in AES V4.

When this  menu item is selected,  the current  top window  is  either
iconified  or  deiconified  (see TeraDesk Windows),  depending  on its
previous state.

If an application has  signed-on itself as an  AV-protocol client, its
windows  may be included in TeraDesk's list of windows; in such cases,
the 'Iconified' command applies to the client's windows as well.

When  this  item  is  selected, the bottom window is moved to the top.
This is  particularly useful when  one window is covered completely by
others, because you can  view  this obscured window without  having to
move or delete the windows which cover it.

If an application  has  signed-on  as an  AV-protocol  client,  it may
include its windows in TeraDesk's  list of windows; in such cases, the
windows cycling command  applies to the client's windows as well. Note
that some AV-protocol clients send hard-coded  ^W  as a simulation  of
a keyboard  shortcut  command  to cycle  windows. This originated from
the Gemini desktop which uses ^W as the shortcut  for cycling windows;
it  is  not very   suitable   for  an  environment  with  configurable
keyboard commands, and may  interfere  with  other  Keyboard shortcuts
defined in TeraDesk.

@{U}4.5.1  Set applications...                                    TeraDesk@{u}

This menu item displays  The listbox dialog in which  you can edit the
list  of   installed   applications.  The  dialog  shows   a  list  of
application  names   (program  names  only,  ignoring  paths).  If  an
application  name is longer  than can fit in the list box, the name is
displayed in shortened form.  You can add  an application to the list,
edit  settings  of  an  already-installed  application, or  delete  an
application  from  the  list. If you press the  Add or  Edit button, a
child dialog  opens, in  which  the  settings  for an application  can
be  edited (if you select the option while a program file  is selected
in a window, the child dialog  will open immediately).

Parameters which can be set, either all manually, or by taking some of
them from the name and location of a file selected in a window, are:

- Application path:
  Location of the application program can be entered or edited.

- Application name:
  Name of the application can be entered or edited.

- Default command line:
  You  may  wish  to  send  other parameters besides  a file name to a
  program. If these are likely to vary from one call of the program to
  another,  the best way  is  to invoke  the program by opening it.
  However, if the other parameters  are constant,  you can set them up
  in the 'Command line' field.

  Whatever  you  write in the Command line will be sent to the program
  when  you  invoke  it  by  double clicking  on  it or by dragging an
  application document to it.

  The  symbols  %f, %n and %p have  a special meaning  when entered in
  the command line:

  %f - This is replaced by the full path  (including drive,  directory
       and file name) to the application document's file(s).

  %F - Same as %f, however file names are converted to lower case.

  %n - This is replaced by the document file name(s) only.

  %N - Same as %n, however file names are converted to lower case.

  %p - This is replaced by the application documents' path(s).

  %P - Same as %p, however path names are converted to lower case.

  In most cases, only one of these symbols  should be specified in the
  command  line;  it will  be  applied  to  all  the names  passed  as
  parameters to the application.  If more  than one  control symbol is
  placed in the command line, each of them will be applied  to all the
  names passed as parameters.

  If any of the parameters  in the command line contains spaces,  that
  parameter  should be  entered between   a pair of  single  or double
  quotes  (the ' or " characters).  If the command line  is to contain
  the quote character, two consecutive quotes should be entered.

- Local environment string  to be  passed to the application:
  Several environment variables can be specified in this string, using
  the format:  VAR1=VAL1 VAR2=VAL2  etc.  i.e.  assignments  should be
  separated by blanks, but without  blanks  around '='. Note that this
  capability may not work in an identical way in all AESes.

  Environment variables  containing spaces or  quote characters should
  be  specified using the same rules as used for the command lines.

- Function key upon which the application can be started:
  Numbers  1 to 10 correspond to the  [F1] to [F10] keys, and 11 to 20
  to the same keys pressed with [Shift] key held down.

- Special use of the application:
  A child dialog opens  in which flags for assigning a special role to
  the  application (such as the editor, or a file viewer) can  be set.
  See Special Applications.  
  
- Application program type:
  A child dialog  (The program type dialog)  appears in which  you can
  set the type of application program.

- List of assigned document types:
  The listbox dialog appears in which a list of filetypes or filenames
  which will be opened  by this applications can be edited.  Rules for
  specifications of name masks apply - See Set mask...

  The standard  TOS  desktop  only allows you to specify one extension
  which  is presumed  to be common to  all the  application documents.
  Tera Desktop  is  much  more  flexible,  and allows  you  to specify
  several complete file names or masks  in which  you can include wild
  cards if you wish.

  With document types  associated  to  an application, you can run the
  program and at the same time pass the name of the  document to it as
  a parameter. You do this by double-clicking on the document.  If the
  application is  already running, a message is sent to it to open the
  document.

  A document type  can be assigned to more than one application.  When
  an attempt  is  made  to open  such  a document,  The listbox dialog
  appears in which  the user can  select one  from the applications to
  which the document has been assigned  (a double-click on  one of the
  listed applications  or a single-click followed  by a click on  'OK'
  will make  a selection).  Applications listed in this dialog can not
  have their parameters edited here.

  Network objects such as web pages and  ftp sites can be  assigned as
  'document types' to applications. Such objects can be represented in
  MiNT or MagiC by name masks like e.g.  http://*  or  ftp://*.*, etc.
  Supported prefixes are currently http:, https:, ftp: and mailto:. In
  single-TOS,  because of name limitations, such name masks have to be
  specified as e.g. HTTP*.*, FTP*.*  etc.

  It is important to note that a file matching the mask on the list of
  any of the programs cannot be printed or displayed  on the screen by
  opening it  in the  normal way.  This merely  invokes the program to
  which  you have  associated it. However,  this  may be overridden by
  holding down [Alternate] as you select it.

With this  menu option  you can  determine  which  files  Tera Desktop
recognises as executable, and various features for these filetypes can
be set. A dialog box is displayed in which one can:

1.Toggle a flag which  indicates whether Tera Desktop  will wait for a
keypress  after a TOS or TTP program has finished. This is useful when
such  programs  write  something to the screen and you want to read it
at leisure.

2. Toggle  a  flag which indicates  whether Tera Desktop will redirect
output to GEMDOS standard handle 2 to the screen.  This is useful e.g.
when using programs compiled with GNU C.

3. Set  which  files  or file types contain programs.  A small listbox
window  contains a list of file name masks; you can scroll the list or
select  an  entry.  Any  file  which  matches  one  of  the  masks  is
recognised  by  Tera Desktop  to be a program. You can add a new mask,
edit  one  already  there which  you  have selected, or delete the one
selected by clicking on the appropriate  button.

See The listbox dialog for more details.

If you add  or edit a name mask,  The program type dialog box  will be
shown in which you must define the file type and and other information
for the program type being defined.

Beside the filetypes  explicitely  specified in this  dialog, TeraDesk
treats as executable (i.e. programs) all files without name extensions
for which the 'execute' rights are set, and such files are  assumed to
be of the  .TTP  type.  This capability  is available  only  for files
without  name extensions  (i.e.  with  names  not  containing  the "."
character) and only in  Unix filesystems that recognize access rights;
therefore it is disabled in single-TOS. 

If you are running Tera Desktop in low or medium screen resolution and
TOS 1.0, this menu item may not be visible  due to limitations of this
TOS version.

@{U}4.5.3  Set desk icons...                                      TeraDesk@{u}

You can use this menu option to install, change or remove icons on the
desktop.  When  you  first  select  it,  a  mini-icon  appears  on the
desktop;  you  can move this about the screen with your mouse till you
click the left mouse button;  by then  you will have placed it  at the
position where you wish the new icon to be displayed.

When you click  the mouse button to  position an icon  on the desktop,
The icon selector dialog box appears. If you selected this menu option
while one or  more desktop  icons  is/are selected  then the mini icon
will not be shown, and The icon selector dialog will open immediately.

In the dialog  you can  define  the type of icon  and  its appearance.
There are four icon types, each of which has a special use:

1. Disk         Items dragged to this icon will be copied to the disk.

2. Printer      Files dragged to this icon will be printed.

3. Trashcan     Files or folders dragged to this icon will be deleted.

4. File/Folder  Icon represents a directory item (file/folder/link).

There are many different designs of icon available. TeraDesk reads its
monochrome icons  from the file named  ICONS.RSC  and colour ones from
the file named CICONS.RSC. See The icons files.

You can scroll  through these different designs  to select the one you
prefer.  You can also  enter  an identifying  letter (for drive icons)
and a title (label) for the icon.

Icons representing folders, files and symbolic links can be  placed on
the  desktop  simply by dragging  them  from their directory onto  the
desktop.  An alternative method  is  to select one or more items  in a
directory  window  and  then  select  Set desk icons...  In this  case
The icon selector dialog  will open, enabling you  to change the icons
assigned by default to selected items.

Desktop icons of network objects  such as  web pages and ftp sites can
be created. An icon of the type  'File/Folder'  should be created  and
then  its path entered  so  as to point to a  network object such as a
web page.  Referenced objects  should  have names  beginning  with one
of the  following prefixes:  http:,  https:,  ftp:  or  mailto:  (case
insensitive).

When a symbolic link is  selected  (see  Symbolic Links),  the desktop
icon to be created can represent either the link itself, or the object
it is referencing, depending on the state of the 'Follow links' option
in the dialog (available only in MiNT or MagiC).

The default form of a  desktop icon is decided  by Tera Desktop  which
determines it  according  to the item's nature. If a  window icon  has
already been assigned  to the  item  being set on  the desktop,  it is
preserved. Subsequent changing  of window  icon  assignments  will not
affect icons already placed  on the  desktop.  Subsequent  changing of
desktop icon  assignments  will  not  affect window  icon  assignments
either.

When a desktop icon represents  a directory item,  the dialog displays
an editable text field (see  Scrolled text fields) into which the path
to the item corresponding to the icon can be entered.

When a  disk-type icon  is placed  on the desktop  without  specifying
its label,  TeraDesk tries to read  the volume label for the specified
partition, and, if it succeeds, sets this text as the icon label.

When a  disk-type icon  is placed  on the desktop  without  specifying
a drive letter, icons for all existing disk drives  for which no icons
have yet  been  assigned  will  be  placed  on the  desktop  at  once,
starting from the specified position (this feature is active only when
adding new icons, not when editing existing ones).

Besides  selecting  'Remove' in The icon selector dialog, an alternate
method of removing desktop icons is to drag them to the trash can.  An
alert will  be displayed,  asking  whether  to remove the icons or  to
delete the selected items.  If 'Remove' is chosen, the selected  icons
will be removed. If 'Delete' is chosen, actual directory items will be
deleted.

With  this  menu  item you can determine the way files and folders are
displayed  when they are represented  as icons (see  Show as icons) in
Directory windows.

When  you select it, The listbox dialog is displayed. One of the three
window icon lists  can be  selected  for viewing  or editing: 'Files',
'Folders' or 'Programs'.

The  dialog box contains  a listbox showing a list of filename  masks.
You  can scroll through these by clicking on the arrows. Each  mask in
the  list  is  associated with an icon and any file, folder or program
whose name matches the mask is depicted by the associated icon.

Using wildcard characters  enables the name masks  to apply to a range
of object names. See Set mask...

You can  add new masks and icons to the list by selecting 'Add' when a
new  dialog box  with  The icon selector dialog is displayed.  You can
enter  a mask  and  select an icon.  You can also delete an entry from
the list by selecting 'Delete' or edit it with 'Edit'.

If  you activate  this option while  a file or folder is selected in a
window or  on the desktop,  The icon selector dialog  will immediately
appear  (icon group  will be set  according to item type). This allows
you to assign icons in a way  that is similar to that  existing in the
TOS desktop.  Only one item at a time can be handled in this way.

@{U}4.5.5  Desk preferences...                                    TeraDesk@{u}

This dialog enables the user to adjust  some options  which affect the
overall look of Tera Desktop:

- Set the dialog box display mode:
  Dialog boxes  can be drawn in  one of  two modes.  Each mode has its
  advantages:

     1. Flying (or buffered) mode:
       In this mode a dialog appears in a box  that can be moved about
       the screen  by clicking on  and dragging  a special button (the
       'ear') in its top right corner.  The screen  under a dialog box
       is saved in a  buffer.  It can thus be restored  rapidly if the
       box is moved.  This  dialog display mode is  generally suitable
       for slower machines.

    2. Window mode:
       In this mode dialogs appear in windows.  This has the advantage
       that  you  can  use  accessories  while  the box  is displayed.
       Windowed dialogs can  be  moved about the screen.  This display
       mode   is  somewhat  slower  than  the  'flying'  mode,  and is
       suitable for faster machines.

  Note that dialog boxes displayed by other programs are not effected.

- Determine the position of the dialog box:
  There are two possibilities:

    1. Under mouse:
       Place the box  at a  point  determined by  the  position of the
       mouse. This option is  of most use when the  display of the box
       is initiated  by a key press.  It is thus  possible  to prevent
       it from covering other objects.

    2. Centred:
       Centre the box on the screen in the standard way.  However, if
       a dialog is  moved to  another  position  on  the screen,  and
       another dialog is opened from it,  it will open in the current
       position, not in the centre of the screen.

- Specify menu shortcuts:
  Use the arrows  to choose a menu item,  then type  the character you
  want to use as the shortcut for this item.
  . Plain keys are possible, just type the key.
  . Combinations with CTRL are possible, prepend the key by ^
  . Some of the special keys  can  be used,  which  should  be entered
    in text form as TAB, BS, DEL and SP for the [Tab],  [Backspace],
    [Delete] and [Space] keys respectively.
  Note that, because  of  the limitations  of  the  scan codes  of the
  Atari keyboards,  some  key combinations  can not  be differentiated
  from others, and some will be recognized as illegal.

- Set the automatic desktop saving option:
  If this  option is selected,  TeraDesk  will save  its configuration
  upon each exit from the program by the Quit/Shutdown menu action.

 4. Toggle confirmation of print operations.

 5. Control whether The copy info dialog will appear.

 6. Control whether selected items remain selected after a copy action
    is finished.
   
 7. Control whether long filenames  are truncated when copied to a FAT
    partition which permits only DOS 8+3 names.

 8. Control the printing  of headers  and separators before/after each
    item being printed

 9. Set  the  size of the copy buffer. This is an area of RAM which is
    used  to store  the  contents of files  being copied.  In general,
    the larger  you set it,  the faster will be  the copying  of large
    files.

10. Set printer line length; lines longer than this size are wrapped.

The  dialog  boxes  displayed  when  a  confirmation  is necessary are
similar to those  in the standard desktop,  but they offer  additional
options when appropriate.

is displayed in which you can:

1. Select a fill pattern for the desktop background

2. Select a colour for the desktop background

3. Select a fill pattern for all window backgrounds

4. Select a colour for all window backgrounds

5. Select a font  for text appearing in  directory or  viewer windows.
You must first select the  'Directory  font' or  'Viewer font' button.
The font selector dialog  will appear,  so that  you can  choose   the
desired font,  its size, colour and style.  Only monospaced  fonts are
selectabe  and style  (bold, italic, etc.)  can be  set  only  for the
viewer windows font.

6. Specify the size of tabs when text is displayed in Text windows.

7. Specify distances betwen icons (in windows and on the desktop).

8. Set whether open windows are to be saved in the configuration file.

The number of available  background patterns is limited  to the sum of
numbers of  fill patterns and hatches  available in VDI.  Selection of
background colours  is limited to the  number of  colours available in
the current video mode. In order for the patterns to be visible in the
selector boxes, colours other than white must be selected.

At least one of the available AESes (i.e. MyAES) has the capability to
display a desktop background picture instead of the colour and pattern
specified for the desktop background object. Similar capability exists
in at least  one utility:  PICDESK by  D.Mequignon. In order to enable
display of  background pictures,  TeraDesk must be started  with white
desktop background colour. In order to have that,  desktop colour must
be set to  white  and TeraDesk  configuration file  saved.  Background
picture can be displayed after the next startup of TeraDesk. 

The user  should beware  that redraw  of monochrome  desktop icons  is
dramatically slowed down  whenever  white  desktop colour is selected.
This setting, and in particular, a background desktop picture,  is not
recommended when running TeraDesk on slower machines with limited RAM.

The Tab size field permits the setting  of the number of blank columns
produced in Text windows when a <TAB>  character is  encountered. This
is a global  default setting;  Tab size  for each of the  text windows
can be changed in the menu of that window.

This dialog can also be used to  adjust  the  horizontal and  vertical
distances  between icons on the desktop and in the windows. Beside the
horizontal and vertical icon grid pitch, the offsets of the icons from
the upper left corner of the icon area can be adjusted. The parameters
are set in the following format:

     Hor.grid: aaa +x
     Ver.grid: bbb +y

where "aaa" and "bbb" are the distances, in pixels, between  the icons, 
in the  horizontal and vertical directions respectively, while "x"  and 
"y" are the offsets from the corner, in pixels, in the same directions.

The default, and minimum permitted, values of these parameters are: 

aaa=80 bbb=46 x=0 y=0 

If you are running Tera Desktop in low or medium screen resolution and
TOS 1.0, this menu item may not be visible  because of the limitations
of this  TOS version.  However, in that case  it can still  be reached
through Keyboard shortcuts.

@{U}4.5.8  Video options...                                       TeraDesk@{u}

Some of the  facilities  presented  in  this dialog  may  not  work in
certain types of environment.  It depends highly on the video hardware
and the OS on which TeraDesk is running.

- Standard resolution:

  Choose one of the 6 standard  ST/TT/Falcon  screen resolutions (some
  of these  may be disabled,  depending on the type  of video hardware
  detected):

  . ST-Low
  . ST-Medium
  . ST-High
  . TT-Low    (40-Columns on a Falcon)
  . TT-Medium (80-Columns on a Falcon)
  . TT-High

- Options:

    1. Toggle a switch to save the palette. If this facility is turned
       on,  the palette is saved  when a program is run  and  restored
       when  it  finishes.  This is useful  if a program  changes  the
       palette  without  restoring  it  at exit.  If  this  option  is
       selected, the palette is also saved to a file  TERADESK.PAL  or
       restored from this file whenever a configuration file is saved/
       restored (use of this option should be avoided in multi-tasking
       environments). See Configuration Files.

    2. Toggle a switch to activate/deactivate the blitter chip. If the
       blitter chip is  not available, this  option  is  disabled. The
       option is available on ST/STe computers only.

    3. Toggle a switch to activate/deactivate the overscan mode.  This
       option is currently compatible only with the original Overscan/
       Lacescan hardware  hack  on an  ST-type  machine  and  switches
       ON/OFF the appropriate signal on the  keyboard ACIA  chip. This
       option is also available on  Falcon computers  where it toggles
       the overscan mode if a TV monitor is connected.

    4. Toggle a switch to  activate/deactivate double-line mode  (with
       a TV connected it is interlace mode).  This option is available
       only on Falcon computers.

    5. Select the number of colours in  the selected video mode.  This
       option is settable only on Falcon computers,  otherwise it just
       displays the current number of colours.

If the  OK button  is  pressed and  a resolution  (or any component of
Falcon video mode) that is different from the  current  one  has  been
selected, and an  AES capable of  resolution  change  is present,  the
computer  will  initiate   a  shutdown  and  resolution  change.  This
operation is generally possible only in some versions of AES 4.

Pressing the  OK  button  will always  cause  TeraDesk  to  redraw the
desktop and  its windows. This can be useful  to  recover from  screen
corruption  which  might  have been  caused by a  misbehaving program.
Since in such cases this dialog may not  be properly displayed, typing
the  key sequence  [Keyboard shortcut for video options][Return]  will
have the same effect.

If you are running Tera Desktop in low or medium screen resolution and
TOS 1.0, this menu item may not be visible  because of the limitations
of this TOS version.

If an external utility  has  been  set  to perform  screen  resolution
change, the Video options  dialog  will not  appear.  In  such a case,
the  external utility will have to do all the work by itself to change
the video mode.

If  you select  this  menu item, you can  load settings  that you have
previously saved in a file.  The file selector is displayed; enter the
name of the  file containing the settings required.  The default  name
for the configuration file of TeraDesk is TERADESK.INF;  depending  on
the settings   made  in  Video options... dialog,  palette file  named
TERADESK.PAL may also be loaded automatically.

If a single file is selected in a  directory window or on the desktop,
when activating  Load settings...  TeraDesk immediately loads the file
without opening the file selector.

If TeraDesk  (DESKTOP.PRG)  itself  is installed  in  TeraDesk  as the
application for TERADESK.INF and similar files  (e.g. TERA*.INF), then
such a configuration file can be double-clicked upon  in order to load
it.  If DESKTOS.PRG  is used,  DESKTOP.PRG has  to be installed as the
application anyway (not DESKTOS.PRG).

Besides mouse selection,  menu items can also be set to be selected by
pressing  a  key  or  a  key combination. These keyboard shortcuts are
user-definable and can be set in the Desk preferences... dialog.

Likewise,  most  buttons  in  dialog boxes  can also be  selected by a
key:  Press  and  hold  down [Alternate] and then press the key of the
character in the button that is underlined.

Boxes  with  arrows  can  be  selected  by  holding down [Control] and
pressing the corresponding cursor (arrow) key on the keyboard.

Directory  windows  on  disk  volume root directories can be opened by
pressing  the  [Alternate][?]  key  combination  ('?' representing the
drive name,  i.e.  characters  A  to  P   or  A  to  Z).  Pressing the
[Alternate][Shift][?]  combination will open the root directory of the
specified disk volume in the existing top window.

If the [Shift][Help] key combination is pressed, TeraDesk will attempt
to call or start the  hypertext-viewer  accessory or program  (usually
this would be ST-Guide),  if any  is installed  as the application for
the *.HYP filetype, and display the hypertext manual for Tera Desktop. 
The installed program  should recognize  the syntax  used by  ST-Guide 
(Tera Desktop's help is opened as "*:\TERADESK.HYP pagename").

If [Help] only is pressed  while any dialog is open, TeraDesk will, in
a similar way, attempt to display the page  from the  hypertext manual
corresponding  to the  currently open dialog.  Dialogs must be  in the
windowed mode (see Desk preferences...)  for this feature to be active
(help is not available in  The font selector dialog  when it is called
by another program).

If [Help] key is pressed  when there are no open dialogs, Tera Desktop  
will display The keyboard help dialog with brief explanations of basic
keyboard commands.

[Undo] can be used to deselect all objects  selected on the desktop or
in the directory windows.

There are also a number of keyboard shortcuts  available which produce
effects that are specific to certain window types.

@{U}4.7 The listbox dialog                                        TeraDesk@{u}

TeraDesk   maintains  lists  of  filetype  masks,  window icon  types,
executable   program   types,   installed  applications  and  assigned
filetypes.  The same type of dialog,  containing a  scrollable listbox
and  five  edit buttons is used to maintain all these lists, but it is
invoked through divers menu items, depending on the use:

Set mask...   to  maintain  a  list  of  predefined filetype masks for
TeraDesk's Directory windows

Set applications... to maintain a list of installed applications

Set program types... to maintain a list of executable file types

Set window icons... to  maintain lists of  icons assigned  to  certain
filenames, filetypes, or folder names

Set document types... to maintain lists of  document types assigned to
applications.  This is  a child dialog  and it is activated  from  the
Set applications... dialog.

Listbox content  is manipulated by five buttons:  Add,  Edit,  Delete,
Up-arrow and Down-arrow.

Add:  opens a child dialog  to enter  data  for an item  which will be
added to the list at the highlighted  position. Depending  on the type
of item being added,  an appropriate dialog is opened.

Edit:  opens  a child dialog  to  edit  data  for an  already existing
item.  Depending on  the type  of item  being  edited,  an appropriate
dialog is opened.

Delete: deletes the highlighted item in the list.

Up-arrow: moves an item up in the list.

Down-arrow: moves an item down the list.

The  purpose  of  the  last two  buttons is to enable editing the item
order.  TeraDesk searches all lists starting from the beginning, until
the   first   match  is  found.  It  may  be  desirable  to   put  the
oft-needed items  nearer to the top of the list,  for faster response.
Also, if more than one list item are defined for similar objects, more 
specific items should be placed in a list above the more general ones.
This is the case, for example, with documenttype assignments for files
with specific names, as exceptions to generally assigned types.

Items  can  be added (or edited) in all of TeraDesk's lists, except in
the lists of  document-types  assigned  to applications, in two  ways:
either  you  can  manually enter all data related to an item,  or  you
can select  an item in a directory window or on the desktop, and  then
open  the  desired   dialog  to  modify  the  default  settings  which
TeraDesk   assigned  for  an  item  added  to  a  list  in  this  way.
Document-types  assigned to  applications can be edited only manually,
being in a child dialog (i.e. they  can not be selected in a directory
window).

Here  you can specify the behaviour of  an application when started in
any way other than double clicking:

Program type determines whether the specified command line is invoked,
as well as some other aspects of program startup.

These program types are recognized:

      GEM       AES/VDI GEM application
      GTP       GEM Takes Parameters
      ACC       Accessory
      TOS       TOS program (no GEM)
      TTP       TOS Takes Parameters; Unix-style command line programs

See also  Types of program files

The default directory for the program or program type can also be set:

Each  program  that  makes  use  of  ancillary files, like resource or
configuration  files,  must  be able to find these files in a specific
directory. This option defines where such directory is located:

    Window   the directory of the top window of Tera Desktop
    Program  directory from which the program is started
    File     path of the first filename parameter in the command line

Compliance of the program to the ARGV protocol can be specified:

The number of characters  which specify  the parameters in the command
line is  limited to 125 in  the standard desktop,  but TeraDesk allows
you up to employ more.  It does this  by using The ARGV protocol.  You
should note that some  GTP  or  TTP  programs do not support  the ARGV
protocol; you can toggle its use on and off by clicking on the box.

If Background option  is checked,  the application  will be started in
background mode if a multi-tasking environment (e.g. MiNT or MagiC) is
present. Only non-GEM programs can be started in this  way; otherwise,
an error is reported. This option is functional in single-TOS as well,
and in such case  the program will be just activated using the Pexec()
function, without closing any windows  or displaying the program title
bar.  This feature turned out to be convenient in single-TOS  e.g. for
sound-playing utilities.

Another way  to start a  program in background is by  holding down the
[Control] key while activating the program.

Some older programs  do not behave well in a multi-tasking environment.
For such program  the  'No multitasking'  option can be set,  in which
case  the program will be  activated as in single-TOS.  Note that this
option has not  yet been implemented in a completely satisfactory way,
and has some effect only in MagiC.

Memory available  for a program  can  be limited,  which is useful for
some programs which grab all the available memory  for themselves. Any
non-zero  value entered in the  memory-limit field  will activate this
option. It will be available only in a multi-tasking environment.

the 'Viewer font' in the  Window options... dialog.  On the top of the
dialog is a scrollable listbox  from which a font can be chosen  (only
monospaced fonts are displayed).  Below the listbox,  on the left side

some  file operations  should be confirmed, the Copy info dialog  will
appear whenever  such an operation  is attempted.  It will also appear
when such an operation has been requested through The AV Protocol.

This dialog displays  the number of  folders  and files  on which  the
operation is to be performed,  the initial source  path  (of the first
selected item) and, if appropriate, the  destination path.

For copy, touch and  move/rename operations, four checkbox buttons are
shown in the dialog:

- Reset date and time
- Reset attributes (and access rights)
- Follow links (for copy, move/rename and delete operations)
- Shorten names (for copy and move/rename operations)

If 'Reset date and time' is set, all files acted upon  will have their
date and time  stamp  changed to current values (system date and time)
or, in the case of the  'touch' operation,  to values specified in the
Info... dialog).

If  'Reset attributes' is  set, attributes  (read-only,  system, etc.)
or access rights  (read, write...) of  all items  acted  upon  will be
reset to  default values  (or, in the case of a 'touch'  operation, to
values specified in Info... dialog).

If 'Follow links' is set, selected Symbolic Links  will be followed to
their referenced objects,  and those objects will be  copied, moved or
deleted  instead  of the links themselves  (except in deletion,  which
will remove both the referenced objects and the links). This option is
available only in MiNT and MagiC.

When  a  TTP-type or GTP-type program (see Types of program files) is
activated  by  clicking  on  its  name or icon, or through the Open...
menu, a dialog box  will appear in which  it is possible  to enter the
required  parameters.  If  the  program  is  activated  by dragging  a
file  onto  the  program  name or icon, this box will not appear.

The command line  is entered  through  a scrolled text field.  Maximum
length of the command line is thus limited to about 250 characters.

If [Insert] is  pressed  while the cursor is  in the editable field in
the dialog,  the file selector  will appear which  can be  of  help in
entering the data if it contains a file or folder name. A double click
by mouse has the same effect.

If the  object  name or  any  of the  parameters  in the  command line
contains spaces, that name/parameter should be  entered between a pair
of single or  double quotes  (the ' or " characters).  If the  command
line is to contain the quote character,  two consecutive quotes should
be entered.

If the same  .TTP or .GTP program is started  several times  in a row,
the command line is preserved (until the name of the program changes).

In many  cases it is needed  to enter a long text (usually a path or a
long filename) into a dialog text field. However, the practical length
of a dialog text field is limited by dialog size and video mode.

To overcome this difficulty,  a new object type  has been implemented:
an input field  which is able to receive  more characters  than can be
made visible.  Whether parts of the text are invisible is indicated by
the characters  '<' and '>' appearing around the field. Use the [Left]
and [Right]  cursor  keys  to scroll  back and forth in the fields. In
this way up to about 250 characters can be entered.

Pressing the [Insert] key while the cursor is in a scrolled text field
opens the file-selector.  The selected file or folder name is inserted
into the field at the cursor position.  A double click  with the mouse
has the same effect.

Dialog  fields  referring  to  file  names  will  have  a  8+3 form if
TeraDesk  is run  in an environment  which does not  support long file
names.  In the  opposite  case  (i.e. if MiNT  or MagiC are detected),
filename forms will be longer and of the Scrolled text field type.

inquiry is made  to the AES whether  the WHITEBAK flag in the resource
file is supported;  if it is, TeraDesk  assumes that the  AES can draw
all those  objects, and  lets the AES do that.  If not, TeraDesk draws
these objects.  A positive side of letting the AES  do it  is that the
appearance of those objects in TeraDesk is then in style  with objects
drawn by the  AES in other applications.  A negative side is that some
objects, when  drawn by some  AESes  look uglier  than  they would be,
had TeraDesk drawn them. Another drawback is  that  e.g. Geneva  marks
relevant objects in a different  way  than MagiC, N.AES or XaAES; that
is not  recognized by TeraDesk,  and so these  capabilities  of Geneva
are left unused.

The behaviour of TeraDesk can be controlled in this matter through the
use of the TERAENV environment variable.  If it contains the character
'D' (as in 'Draw'), TeraDesk  will draw  these extended  object types,
regardless of whether an AES supports them.   See also  Installation.

      Objects and Icons

@{U}5.1  Objects: introduction                                    TeraDesk@{u}

Several kinds of objects can appear in TeraDesk's Directory windows or
on  the  desktop.  They are represented  graphically  by icons  or (in
Directory windows)  by  name strings.  Objects  can be  manipulated by
moving or  copying them,  by 'opening' them,  or  by 'dragging'  other
objects onto them. See: Opening objects and icons  Dragging Objects.

Known object types are:

1. Disk volume:

It represents  the root directory  of a disk partition. This object is
always displayed as an icon and can appear  only on  the desktop. Name
of a disk volume  object consists  of a single letter A to Z. However,
a more descriptive name,  up to 12 characters long, can be assigned to
the icon  as a label. If no icon label is set for a disk volume object
but a partition it represents  has a volume label assigned to it, this
string will be shown as the icon label.

2. Folder:

It represents  a (sub)directory  on a disk partition.  When it is in a
directory window, it can be displayed either as an icon or in the form
of a text string.  When on the desktop,  it is always  displayed as an
icon.

Folder name can be at most 8+3 characters long in Single-TOS or on FAT
filesystem,  and up to  127 characters  long  in a filesystem  that is
capable  of handling long filenames.  Complete path to a folder can be
at most  127 characters  long in Single-TOS  and up to  255 characters
long  in more advanced filesystems.  When a folder object is displayed
as an icon,  its name  is shown  in an abbreviated  form as  the  icon
label,  and can be at most  12 characters long (icon label can also be
set to a string different than the actual name  of the object).

3. File:

It represents  either a normal file  or one of  several special object
types on the  U:\ drive.  When it is in a  directory window, it can be
displayed either as an icon or as a string. When it is on the desktop,
it is always  displayed as an icon.  Rules for naming  of file objects
are the same as for folder objects (see above).

4. Symbolic link:

In some filesystems it represents  a special file that is a pointer to
other file or directory.  When it is in a directory window,  it can be
displayed either as an icon or as a string. When on the desktop, it is
always displayed  as an icon.  This  object type  is not  available in
Single-TOS.  Rules for naming of symbolic link objects are the same as
for folder and file objects (see above). See Symbolic Links

5. Network object:

It represents the URL  of an object (e.g. a web page or a ftp site) on
the network. This object is always displayed as an icon and can appear
only on the desktop. See Set desk icons...

6. Printer:

It represents a printing device  connected to the parallel port of the
computer.  Its name can be set  as an  icon label  up to 12 characters
long. See also Print...

7. Trash can:

The purpose of this object  is to visualize the operation  of deletion
of files and folders.  Objects that are 'dragged' to the trash can are
deleted.  Name of the  trash can can be set as an icon  label up to 12
characters long. See also Delete...

      Objects and Icons

@{U}5.2  Opening objects and icons                                TeraDesk@{u}

An object  in a directory window  or  on the desktop  can be opened by
double  clicking  on it, or by first selecting it and using the 'Open'
item in the 'File' menu.

What happens when you open an object depends on what sort of object it
is;  the results  may  be  modified  in several cases  by pressing the
[Alternate]  key  as you open the object.  Other objects can be opened
in other ways. The results for the different objects are:

1. Disk volume:

A  new  window  which  contains  the  objects in its root directory is
opened.

Disk  volumes  may  also  be  opened  by  holding down [Alternate] and
pressing the key corresponding to the letter of the drive.

If  both  the [Shift] and [Alternate] keys are held down, a new window
will  not  be  opened,  but  the  directory  will  be displayed in the
topmost window on the desktop.

2. Folder:

If  the  folder is represented by an icon on the desktop, a new window
containing its directory will be opened.

If  the folder  is in a directory window,  the contents of that window
will  be replaced by the directory of the folder, as with the standard
desktop.  If  [Alternate]  is held down as the folder is opened, a new
window containing its directory will be opened.

Note that the folder name  '..'  stands for a folder one  level higher
in the directory structure (parent folder). If you open such a folder,
the effect is to  replace  the contents of the window by  this higher-
level directory. If you do this holding down [Alternate], a new window
is created containing the higher-level directory.

3. File:

A.  If  the file  is  recognized  as a  program,  the program  will be
invoked.  If  the  program is of GTP or TTP type, a dialog box will be
displayed first.  You should enter  the parameters required in it. See
Set program types...

B.  If the file is not a program  but matches  one of the masks set up
in the  'Set  applications' menu item,  the associated program will be
started, and the name of the file passed as a parameter.

If  you  hold  down  [Alternate]  as you open the file, the associated
program  is not started,  and it is  not recognised  as an application
file.

C.  With all other files, a dialog box is displayed and you can opt to
show the file, edit it, run it as a program, open it with a particular
application, or cancel any action. See Open...

4. Symbolic link:

The object that is  pointed to  by the symbolic link  is opened  in an
appropriate way. See Symbolic Links

5. Network object:

The application assigned to the object's 'document type' is started or
the name of the object is sent  to an already running application that
has been associated with the object type.

@{U}5.3  Dragging Objects                                         TeraDesk@{u}

Icons or objects (the Source object)  can be dragged to other icons or
objects  (the  Destination  object)  by  holding  down  the left mouse
button  and  moving  to  a new position on the desktop. When the mouse
button  is finally released, the result depends on both the source and
destination objects.

The  results for the various destination objects are listed below. The
first three destinations require the source to be a file or folder.

1. File(s), Folder(s) -> Disk drive

Source  files  and  folders  (with their contents) are copied into the
root directory of the destination disk volume.

2. File(s), Folder(s) -> Folder

Source files or folders will be copied into the folder.

3. File(s), Folder(s), Desktop icon(s) -> Trashcan

The files or the folders together with their  contents are deleted. If
source objects are on the desktop,  it is also possible to remove only
the icons, not the actual items that they represent.

For the next three destinations, the source can only be a file:

4. File -> Program

The  program is started,  and  the name of the file is passed to it as
a parameter (which may be ignored if the started program is not of GTP
or TTP type).

5. File -> Printer

The contents of the file are sent to the printer.

6. File(s), Folder(s) -> Directory window

Objects dragged to a directory window  will be either copied  or moved
to it, depending on a keyboard key held pressed  during the operation.

See also:  Directory windows  Copy and print...

7. File -> Text window

If a single file is dragged  to an  open text window,  the contents of
the window will be replaced and  the window will display the new file.
If an attempt is made  to drag more than one file,  or an object other
than a file to a text window, an  'Illegal copy' error will occur. See
also  Text windows.

8. File(s), Folder(s) -> window of an application.

If the window is that of an application  supporting the AV-protocol, a
VA_DRAGACCWIND  message,  containing  pointers  to   the names of  the
dragged objects, is sent  to the application,  which then has  to take
action on the dropped object(s).

If TeraDesk  is running  on a suitable  multi-tasking operating system
and the target application is not an AV-protocol client, a Drag & Drop
message is sent to it.  If the application understands Drag & Drop, it
will take action on the dropped objects as defined by the application.
If  the application  doesn't  react,  the action will time out and the
user will be notified.

See also  Supported Protocols

9. File(s), Folder(s), Drive(s) -> Desktop

If  the source object  is already  on the desktop, it will be moved to
a  new  position  defined  by  the  mouse position when the button was
released.

If  the source object  is in a  directory window,  the object  will be
installed on the desktop as an icon. Once so installed, it can be used
as if it were in a window.

Note that all copy operations  mentioned above  (except items 7 and 8)
can be modified by pressing [Control] as the mouse button is released.
When this  is done,  the file or folder  is moved  rather than copied;
this means  that  the source is  deleted  after  it is  copied  to the
destination  (if the source and  the destination are  on the same disk
volume, the move operation involves  just renaming of the item(s), not
actual copying).

If,  instead,  [Alternate]  is  pressed  as  the button is released, a
dialog  box  is displayed. With this you can rename the new version of
the source which is placed in the destination.

Another way to modify a copy operation is  to press the  left or right
[Shift] key when the operation  is initiated.  This will  activate the
'Update' or 'Restore' copy modes respectively, in which existing files
will be overwritten only if they have an older time/date (update mode)
or a newer  time/date (restore mode) than the file being copied to the
location.

Note  also  that  if  a file or folder, which is installed in the Tera
Desktop as an icon is deleted, the icon is removed as well.

If, during  a  copy  operation, a file or folder with the same name as
the  source is  found  in  the destination,  a dialog box will appear.
This gives the user an opportunity  to  rename  either the destination
object or the source object,  to  overwrite the destination,  to  skip
that file, abort the operation, or  to continue.  This dialog box will
appear  in all such  instances  of  a name  conflict  and  can not  be
switched off.

Finally, note  that a touch, move, copy, delete or print operation can
be aborted by pressing the [Esc] key. Touch and delete operations will
be aborted  after the action upon the currently  processed object  has 
been completed.  Copy and move  operations  will be aborted  after the
currently  processed  contents of  the copy buffer  has  been  read or
written. If a file  being copied  at  that  moment  already exists  at
destination, it (i.e. the destination file) will be deleted.

@{U}5.4  The icons files                                          TeraDesk@{u}

TeraDesk  holds  its  images  of  icons  in  the files named ICONS.RSC
and/or  CICONS.RSC; the first file should contain monochrome icons and
the  second file colour icons. These files should reside in TeraDesk's
folder (see Installation).

Icons  files  contain the bit-maps of the icons  which you can  select
in  the  'Add'  and 'Edit' options in both the 'Set desk icons...' and
'Set window icons...' menu item dialog boxes.

TeraDesk decides from the AES version whether ICONS.RSC or  CICONS.RSC
should be loaded.  If CICONS.RSC file can not be found, TeraDesk falls
back to the monochrome ICONS.RSC file.

It is  recommended  to  have   only   monochrome  icons  in  ICONS.RSC
(otherwise TeraDesk might crash on older single TOSes). In CICONS.RSC,
any sort of icon is allowed.

If you  do not  have much memory,  and use an AES which  is capable of
handling colour icons,  it is  possible  to remove CICONS.RSC and thus
save quite a lot of memory. Monochrome icons will be used then.

If you have a resource editor,  you can add your own icons to the file
or replace those  already there with your own.  The maximum size of an
icon is  64 pixels wide by 32 pixels high, and the maximum size of the
file is  64 Kb. Do  not  add any other objects  to this resource file;
if you do,  it will not load.  Users with TOS 2.06 or higher installed
on their computers can also use  the  icons resource file  that  comes
with  these machines  (or with TOS) in place of  ICON.RSC.  This  file
should be copied to  Tera Desktop's folder  and renamed to  ICONS.RSC.
Any file used should  contain  certain icons  which are  essential  to
TeraDesk. Many suitable icon collections  can also be found on various
ftp sites.

The  icons  are identified by the name  held in the icon data. That is
the 12 character name  in 6X6 font  displayed  under or over the icon.
This makes it possible to have  the icons in any order in the resource
file (note: do not use the  '@' character in icon names / labels; this
character  is used by TeraDesk  to mark spaces in strings saved in the
configuration file).

There should be at least 7 icons in the resource file,  which are used
to represent:

      Floppy disk drives:     icon named  'FLOPPY'
      Hard disk partitions:   icon named  'HARD DISC'
      Files:                  icon named  'FILE'
      Programs:               icon named  'APP'
      Folders:                icon named  'FOLDER'
      Trash cans:             icon named  'TRASH'
      Printers:               icon named  'PRINTER'

If an icon file is used which does not contain icons with these names,
suitable icons in the file should be renamed using a resource editor.

Note that  the above  default icon names  are not hard-coded,  but are
read from  DESKTOP.RSC;  thus,  it is  possible to  customize  them if
TeraDesk is translated to other language(s).

If an icon name can not be found in  the icons resource file, TeraDesk
attempts  to use  one of the default icons  (see above),  according to
the item type. If that does not succeed either, then the first icon in
the icons resource file is used instead.

@{U}6  Symbolic Links                                             TeraDesk@{u}

Symbolic links are  special files  which contain pointers  to files or
folders  that may be located  elsewhere on a disk drive. They  are not
supported by  all versions of the  operating system or the file system
(i.e. MiNT  or MagiC  is needed  in order  to exploit  symbolic links,
because the standard GEMDOS does not support them).

Symbolic links  can be created by  using the New... menu title  in the
File  menu.  If a  single object  is selected  when this menu title is
activated,  a symbolic link to that object  will be created in the top
directory window.

Symbolic links can be copied, moved or deleted  just like normal files
and folders.  During these  operations,  only the links  are copied or
moved,  not the  actual objects  they  are referencing. This behaviour
can be modified by setting  'Follow links' in The copy info dialog and
in the Set desk icons... dialog.  If any of these  options is selected
the operations are applied to the referenced objects, not to the links
(except deleting,  which removes  both the referenced objects  and the
links). Note that when a link is deleted, the object it is referencing
(the target) is NOT deleted.

Users  should  beware that  the  'Follow links'  option is  limited to
objects directly selected in a directory window or on the desktop. Any
links in the subdirectories  of a  selected object  are manipulated as
links (that is,  they are never followed  to the referenced  objects);
Othwerwise,  uncontrolled file operations and endless recursions might
occur.

Information on symbolic links can be found through the Info... dialog.
It will permit renaming  of the link,  or changing  of the path to the
object it  is referencing.  (Changing the path to the target object in
fact amounts to deleting the link and creating a new one).

When an object  which is  a symbolic link is 'opened', the path to the
referenced object is followed  to establish what type  of object it is
(file, folder or program). The appropriate action is then taken.

When an object which is a link is passed as an argument  to a program,
the path to the referenced object is followed  so that the real object
name will always be passed.

Note that in the current  version  of TeraDesk  this  may  not  always
work consistently, e.g. if an object is  opened in  a folder  which is
open in an object which  is a link to  a folder,  the  real path  will
not be passed.

Have also  in mind that,  generally,  Tera Desktop  may in  some cases
become confused  by  symbolic links  referencing  symbolic links.  The
creation and manipulation of such objects should be avoided.

When a symbolic link contains only the name of  the referenced object,
TeraDesk will supply the path of the link itself  (and append the name
of  the referenced  object).  

Symbolic links to network objects such as  web pages and ftp sites can
be created. For the time being, this cannot be done directly; instead,
a sybolic link  to  an  existing  file  should be  created,  and  then
modified so  as to point to a  network object  like e.g.  a  web page.
Referenced objects  should  have  names  beginning  with  one  of  the
following prefixes: http:, https:, ftp: or mailto: (case insensitive).

@{U}7  TeraDesk Windows                                           TeraDesk@{u}

Two kinds of windows may be displayed by TeraDesk:

7.1  Directory windows
7.2  Text windows

You  can  control  windows  in  the  standard manner using the various
boxes  and  sliders.  In  Tera Desktop  you  can also control  them by
selecting menu items or by pressing various keys.  These keyboard keys
produce specific effects:

[Clr Home] Jump to top of window

[Shift] [Clr Home] Jump to bottom of window

[<user defined shortcut>] Toggle the Iconified state of the top window

[<user defined shortcut>] Toggle the Full state of the top window

[<user defined shortcut>] Close the top window

[<user defined shortcut>] Close all windows

[<user defined shortcut>] Duplicate the top window

[<user defined shortcut>] Cycle windows

[Cursor (arrow)]  These keys scroll the window in the direction of the
arrow.  If a [Shift] key is pressed at the same time as the arrow key,
the  window  scrolls  by  a whole page,  otherwise by a single line or
column. On systems using a PC keyboard, [Page up] and [Page down] keys
have the same effect as [Shift][Cursor up] and [Shift][Cursor down].

There are also a number of other keyboard commands  which are specific
to Directory windows or Text windows.

It  is  possible  to  'iconify'  the windows of TeraDesk in the  AESes
which  support that operation  (i.e. which are  AES 4  compatible). An
iconified  window  is  reduced  in size  so that it  contains just one
icon:  a  file,  a folder  or  a  disk drive,  depending on the window
content.  The actual size of an iconified window is  determined by the
AES. In some AESes this is settable by  the user;  in such  case it is
recommended to set it to 80x64 pixels.

An iconified window is automatically moved to a position determined by
the AES, usually to some unocupied space near the lower left border of
the  screen. When a window is deiconified it will automatically return
to the position and size it had at the moment it was iconified.

To iconify a window,  click  on the window gadget, usually represented
by  a triangle,  immediately left to the 'Fuller'  gadget in the upper
right corner  of the window.  Double-click  on an  iconified window in
order to deiconify it.

A window  can  also  be  iconified  (or vice versa)  by  selecting the
'Iconified' menu item.

The 'Fuller'  gadget  in the upper  right corner of  TeraDesk  windows
causes the window to  expand in order to show  as much as possible  of
the window content on the screen. Note that if the complete content of
the window can be displayed on the screen, the window will be expanded
only as much  as needed - unless any  of the [Shift] keys  are pressed
while the 'Fuller'  gadget is clicked.  In the latter case, the window
will be expanded  to  fill  the desktop.  Window size  may in fact  be
slightly  smaller  than  the  desktop size  because  of  the  rounding
dependent on window font size and the current setting of the icon/text
mode.

If the 'Fuller' of a fulled window is  clicked again,  the window will
return  to its previous size.  However,  any action which changes  the
extents of the displayed material (such as window sizing, font change,
icon/text mode change, etc.)  will reset  the  'fulled'  state  of the
window  and the  next click  on the  'Fuller'  will  again  cause  the
window to be fulled to a size appropriate for the new content.

An effect identical to clicking the 'Fuller' gadget can be obtained by
selecting the 'Full' menu item.

@{U}7.1  Directory windows                                        TeraDesk@{u}

The  contents  (folders  and files) of a directory are shown as in the
standard  desktop.  Files and folders can be displayed in text mode or
icon mode (see Show as icons).

The amount of information  displayed in a  window can be controlled by 
settings in the View menu. See Menu title: View 

In text mode,  all folder names in a directory windows are preceded by
a special character (the 'fuller' mark), the same as the  built-in TOS
desktop. The names of all executable files are preceded by a '-'.

An  autoselector  feature is available in  directory windows;  objects
in windows can be automatically selected when parts of their names are
typed on the keyboard.  Objects are selected if they conform to one of
the following patterns:

  <typed characters>*.* (in FAT filesystem with 8+3 names only)
  <typed characters>.*  (in FAT filesystem with 8+3 names only)
  <typed characters>*

Wildcards '?' and  '[<chars>]'  can be used  among <typed characters>.
See Set mask...

As typing  characters  on  the  keyboard  may  also be  interpreted as
activating  a menu item  via a keyboard  shortcut,  possible conflicts
with single-key menu shortcuts are resolved in the following way:

 - If there are no single-key menu shortcuts defined  (except [Tab] or
   [Delete], which are permitted), the autoselector is always active.

 - If single-key  menu shortcuts  have been defined, the  autoselector
   must be toggled on/off using the [Insert] key. This action disables
   or enables  the keyboard  menu  shortcuts  in  alternation with the
   autoselector.

 - [Return] key can be used  to open the objects selected  through the
   autoselector,  because  the keyboard shortcut  normally assigned to
   Open... function may be temporarily disabled while the autoselector
   is active.

The autoselector is reset  upon each change of the top window, or upon
each loading of the configuration file,  or whenever the [Insert]  key
is pressed.  One can  use [Backspace]  to delete  the  last  character
entered into the autoselector.

Pressing the  [Esc] key causes  the directory of the  top window to be
read again and the window contents to be refreshed.

Files and folders dragged to a directory window will be  either copied
or moved to that directory,  depending on the keyboard key  being held
during the operation. See Dragging Objects.

Directory  windows  can  be controlled to some extent through menus or
keyboard  shortcuts.   See  also:  Menu title: File   Menu title: View

@{U}7.2  Text windows                                             TeraDesk@{u}

The  contents of a file are displayed. This may be  in either ASCII or
Hex format.

ASCII mode is suitable for readable text files, while Hex mode is more
suitable  for binary files.  On opening  or re-reading  a text window,
Tera Desktop attempts  to determine  the correct mode by examining the
contents of the file.

Every  text  window has its own menu bar with one title, 'Viewer'. You
must click  on this  to  see  the two items  it contains. I.e. it is a
click-down rather than a drop-down menu.

The  first item, 'Tabsize' , shows a dialog box when selected. In this
you  can  set  the  tab size; the number of columns skipped when a Tab
symbol is encountered in the text.

The second,  'Hexmode',  enables  you to toggle between ASCII mode and
Hex mode. When 'Hexmode' is ticked, the file is shown in hex mode.

Certain keyboard keys,  besides those already mentioned,  have special
effects in a text window:

Pressing the [Space] key causes scrolling to the next page.

Pressing the [Return] key causes scrolling to the next line.

Pressing the  [Esc]  key causes the contents of the top text window to
be read again and the window to be refreshed.

Dragging a -single- file  to a text window will cause  the contents of
the window to be replaced with  the contents of the dragged file (this
can be faster than opening a new text window).

@{U}8 Special Applications                                        TeraDesk@{u}

Tera Desktop can mark  some installed applications  for  special uses,
such as e.g. an editor or a file viewer. These assignments can be made
in the Set applications... dialog. 

Currently,  one of the following  special roles can be assigned  to an
installed application:

  . Editor                 (only one application can be marked)
  . Viewer                 (only one application can be marked)
  . Autostart              (more than one application can be marked)
  . Shutdown               (more than one application can be marked)
  . Resolution changer     (only one application can be marked)
  . File search            (only one application can be marked)
  . File comparing         (only one application can be marked)
  . Floppy format          (only one application can be marked)
  . Right button extension (only one application can be marked)

Applications specified for  viewer, shutdown, resolution changer, file
search,  file comparing  and  floppy formatting  will,  if  specified,
completely substitute TeraDesk's internal routines  for handling those 
operations.
  
Application flagged  as  'Right button extension'  will  be  activated
whenever  the right  mouse button  is clicked.  If the  application is 
already running, VA_START  will be sent to it. If  there are  selected
objects in  a directory window or on the desktop,  their names will be
sent to the  application. The user should note that, if an application
is flagged as 'Right bbutton extension',  normal TeraDesk's  behaviour
regarding the  right mouse button  clicks  (single  right-click is  by
default treated as right-button-pressed-plus-left-doubleclick) will be
disabled. 

Applications flagged as 'Autostart' will be started automatically when
TeraDesk starts. There will be a delay of a couple of seconds  between
each application  being  started,  to  allow  the  started application
to configure itself, shrink used memory, etc.

Applications  flagged as 'Shutdown'  will execute  with  a delay  of 6
seconds between them,  when 'Shutdown' is selected among Quit/Shutdown
options in  the dialog activated from the @{File link "Menu title: File"} menu.  This  (or these)
application(s),  if specified,  have  to perform all activities needed
for shutdown;  the internal  shutdown  procedure  of TeraDesk  will be
disabled.
  
Some special application uses become effective immediately after being
set; some become effective upon  next start of TeraDesk (assuming that
the desktop configuration has been saved meanwhile).

It may be of interest  to note that,  if a special application  marked
for autostart,  shutdown,  floppy formatting or  video mode changer is
already running,  any request to start it again  as a 'special' one is
silently ignored  (e.g.  if an  autostart-marked application  is still
running when  TeraDesk is restarted,  the said application will not be
started again).

@{U}9 Configuration Files                                         TeraDesk@{u}

By default, TeraDesk 4.* uses two configuration files:

TERADESK.INF holds the complete configuration of the Desktop.
TERADESK.PAL holds the colour palette.

Users can  load and save  configuration files  (but not palette files)
with other names  using the  Load settings...  and Save settings as...
menu actions.

When started, Tera Desktop searches for the default configuration file
TERADESK.INF  first  in  the  current  directory,  then  in  the  root
directory,  then in the directories specified by the  PATH environment
variable, and lastly in the directory of the (Tera Desktop) program.

The configuration files of TeraDesk V4.* are in plain ASCII text form.
Information in the files is divided  into blocks which  are  delimited
by { } parentheses and identified by keywords, for example:

  icon=
  {
    name=EVEREST
    labl=EVEREST
    type=5
    tgtt=5
    path=D:\EDITORS\EVEREST\EVEREST.PRG
    xpos=7
    ypos=3
  }

Blocks  of  information  in the configuration files  are structured by
blank  lines and indentation of one or several <TAB> characters.  This
is purely a cosmetic effect.

In  order  to  save  space,  lines  in  the  configuration  files  are
terminated by <LF> only (this can be easily changed during compilation
of the  program). However, TeraDesk will not complain of <CR><LF> line
termination either.

The configuration files  of TeraDesk 4.* are  in text  form,  but they
are NOT intended to be  edited by hand,  although it is possible to do
so. The text form  of the  configuration files is  a consequence of an
implementation of the 'keyword  =  value'  concept which  enables easy
testing  of  file contents  and  maintaining of compatibility  between
upgrades. Editing of configuration files  by  hand,  unless  you  know
-exactly-  what you  are doing,  can cause undesired effects,  or even
crash TeraDesk.

However,  there is  one  item in the  configuration  file that  can be 
changed -only- by editing  the file  (but normally there  would not be
any need to do so). These are:

maxd=256 - initial number of directory entries in windows

Item maxd can be changed to a lower value in order to save some memory
in very tight  RAM configurations,  or to  a higher value  for quicker 
directory opening, if directories with many files are expected.

The palette file is optional and can be used to restore colour palette
after programs  that may corrupt it,  or to set  some specific palette
when Tera Desktop is started.  Whether it is used or not can be set in
Video options...  Save palette  option  should  be  avoided  in multi-
tasking environments.

@{U}10  Supported Protocols                                       TeraDesk@{u}

TeraDesk supports  several protocols  for passing information  between
the applications:

  10.1 The ARGV Protocol
  10.2 The AV Protocol
  10.3 The FONT Protocol
  10.4 The Drag & Drop Protocol

@endnode

      Supported Protocols

@{U}10.1  The ARGV Protocol                                       TeraDesk@{u}

In  GEMDOS the length of a command line is limited  to 125 characters.
The ARGV protocol  makes  much longer command lines possible.  This is
done by passing the parameters through the ARGV environment variable.

A disadvantage  of the protocol is  that many programs  do not support
such long command lines and may  even crash.  For this reason TeraDesk
enables you to switch the protocol on and off  in  Set applications...
and Set program types...

There  are  two  ways  you  can  avoid  this difficulty  with the ARGV
protocol:

1. Install programs which do not support the ARGV separately using the
'Set program types...' menu item.  Enter their  full names in the list
of file types  and switch off the  ARGV protocol  for them.  Make sure
you enter their names  nearer to the top of the programtypes list than
any other name masks which they might match.

2. Do the inverse of 1:  Switch off the ARGV protocol for all programs
but enter the names of those that do separately.

Yet another possibility  is to  install them  as applications with the
ARGV protocol switched off.

For program files  which  are  not installed as applications,  but for
which the ARGV flag is set  (i.e. it is set for the respective program
type),  this protocol is used only  if the command line is longer than
125 characters.  Otherwise, the default  command-passing mechanism  of
the operating system is used.

Note that different AESes do not behave identically regarding the ARGV
protocol,  and the  passing of  command lines  generally,  because  of
slightly  different behaviour  of the shel_write()  function  in those
AESes.  Problems may  be  encountered  when  passing parameters  (e.g.
file names) which contain spaces or quote characters,  or when passing
both the parameters and a local environment.

The functionality of the ARGV protocol in Tera Desktop can be modified
by specifying the flag  'A' in the environment variable  TERAENV, such
as:

    TERAENV=A

which will force Tera Desktop  to bypass the ARGV-composing  mechanism
in shel_write() and to build a local environment string  with the ARGV
variable appended  whenever starting a program which understands ARGV,
regardless   of the length  of the  command line.  This  may  help  if
problems are encountered.

      Supported Protocols

@{U}10.2  The AV Protocol                                         TeraDesk@{u}

This protocol (first developed for use with the Gemini desktop) allows
certain blocks  of  information  to  be  passed  between  concurrently
running applications, and actions to be performed on the basis of that
information.  In order to utilize this protocol, an 'AV-Server' has to
be declared through an environment variable, e.g. for TeraDesk:

  AVSERVER=DESKTOP

Clients using this protocol sign-on  to the server and request certain
actions by sending messages.  Generally, upon receiving a request, the
server  performs  an  action and  replies by  sending to the client an
appropriate acknowledgment message.

TeraDesk currently supports  a  large subset  of  AV-protocol  message
exchanges (listed below in client request / server reply pairs):

AV_PROTOKOLL/VA_PROTOSTATUS:Establish client-server  communication and
                            inform each other of capabilities.

AV_EXIT:                    Terminate client-server communication.

AV_SENDKEY:                 Pass an unused key code to the server

VA_START/AV_STARTED:        Pass parameters to the client.  AV_STARTED
                            reply is ignored.

AV_ASKFILEFONT/VA_FILEFONT: Ask the server  about the current font for
                            the Directory windows

AV_ASKCONFONT/VA_CONFONT:   Ask the server  about  the current console
                            window font.  Currently, TeraDesk  replies
                            by   sending  the  directory  window  font
                            info.

VA_FONTCHANGED:             Inform any AV-client  which had previously
                            requested  the  directory font  that  this
                            font has changed.

AV_OPENWIND/VA_WINDOPEN:    Tell the server to open a directory window
                            with the given path.

AV_XWIND/VA_XOPEN:          Similar to the above,  but with additional
                            parameters passed.  Currently, some of the
                            additional  parameters  are ignored;  this
                            capability  is not fully compliant  to the
                            specifications.

AV_ACCWINDOPEN:             Inform  the server  that  the  client  has
                            opened  a  window.  This  window  is  then
                            included in TeraDesk's  window cycling and
                            can also  be closed,  fulled  or iconified
                            from TeraDesk's Window menu.

AV_ACCWINDCLOSED:           Inform the  server  that  the  client  has
                            closed a window.

VA_DRAGACCWIND:             Inform the client  that objects  have been
                            dragged to its window.

AV_COPY_DRAGGED/VA_COPY_COMPLETE:   Replies to VA_DRAGACCWIND

AV_DRAG_ON_WINDOW/VA_DRAG_COMPLETE: Inform  the  server  that  objects
                                    have been placed  on  its  windows
                                    or the desktop.

AV_STARTPROG/VA_PROGSTART:  Tell the server  to start  an  application
                            with  a  given  name,  or  an  application
                            that will open a file with a given name.

AV_VIEW/VA_VIEWED:          Tell  the server  to start  an application
                            which  is  the viewer for  the given file.
                            Currently,  TeraDesk does not  distinguish
                            between  filetype-specific   viewers   and
                            processing  applications,  it  will  start
                            the first application  for which the given
                            filetype is assigned.

AV_PATH_UPDATE:             Tell the server  to  update  a window with
                            the given path.

AV_FILEINFO/VA_FILECHANGED  Tell the server to show  information about
                            the files the names of which are passed.

AV_DELFILE/VA_FILEDELETED   Tell the server to delete some files.

AV_COPYFILE/VA_FILECOPIED   Tell the server  to  copy  some files.  In
                            the current implementation,  this function
                            is not  fully compliant to specifications:
                            symbolic links can not be created.

VA_PATH_UPDATE              Inform clients of a change in a directory.

AV_STATUS                   Ask the server to save the client's status.

AV_GETSTATUS/VA_SETSTATUS   Aks the server about saved client status.

AV_SETWINDPOS               Fix  the  position  of   the  next  client
                            window to be opened.

Messages currently not supported:

AV_OPENCONSOLE/VA_CONSOLEOPEN  Open the console window

AV_ASKOBJECT/VA_OBJECT         Ask for the names of selected objects.

In the single-TOS version, only the following messages are supported:

AV_PROTOKOLL/VA_PROTOSTATUS
AV_EXIT
AV_SENDKEY
VA_START/AV_STARTED
AV_ASKFILEFONT/VA_FILEFONT
AV_ACCWINDOPEN
AV_ACCWINDCLOSED
VA_DRAGACCWIND
AV_COPY_DRAGGED/VA_COPY_COMPLETE
AV_STARTPROG/VA_PROGSTARTED

This limitation is  a consequence of the  desire to reduce the size of
the Desktop program by removing options which are  very unlikely to be
used in single-TOS.  However,  TeraDesk can be compiled for single-TOS
with full AV-protocol support.

Certain AV-protocol data is exchanged between Tera Desktop and clients
through  a globally  available  memory buffer.  Size of this buffer in 
Tera Desktop is between 0.2% and 0.4% of the largest free memory block
at the time of allocation,  but always at least  1KB and no  more than 
128KB. It should be noted  that in  some cases the size of this buffer
may limit the number of names  that can be handled  in one AV-protocol
operation. 

In a multi-tasking  environment  with  memory protection, TeraDesk may
run into problems  with some AV-protocol clients,  and  fail with  the
'memory protection: type private' error.  This  will most  probably be
a fault of a badly programmed  AV-protocol client that doesn't set its
data-exchange buffer to be globally available. In some cases it can be
cured if the  memory-protection flag in  the header   of the offending
AV-protocol client is  set to 'readable' or, if that doesn't help,  to
'supervisor'  or  'global'. Examples of such programs are ST-Guide and
aMail.

Note that the nature of the  AV-protocol is  such that  the  AV-server
(i.e. TeraDesk in this case) will  crash  first  if  it encounters  an
offending client;  the  client will not be affected.

TeraDesk supports  the most important functions  of the FONT protocol,
which was introduced by Christian Grunenberg.

TeraDesk can be installed  as a  font selector for  other applications
supporting this protocol (e.g. ST-Guide or aMail). When an application
asks for a font change, The font selector of TeraDesk will be opened.

For successful operation the following criteria must be fulfilled:

-TeraDesk  must be running  in  parallel to  the  application - either
 an application running  as  a desk accessory under  single-TOS or one
 working in a multi-tasking environment

-The environmental variable FONTSELECT must be set as:

 FONTSELECT=DESKTOP

In the  current version  of TeraDesk  only one  instance  of the  font
selector can be opened at any time.

This protocol was introduced by Atari for MultiTOS, and it can be used
only in a multi-tasking environment.

The protocol is automatically  operated  if  one or more  objects in a
window  are  Drag & Dropped  onto  a  window   belonging  to   another
application.  TeraDesk can currently  operate only  as  a  Drag & Drop
sender,  i.e. it can not  receive objects  dragged to its windows from
other applications  (however, TeraDesk can act both as a sender and as
a receiver when objects are dragged & dropped using the AV-protocol).
