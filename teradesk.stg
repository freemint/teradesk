@{U}1.1  About the Tera Desktop                                   TeraDesk@{u}  
  
Tera Desktop (TeraDesk) is a replacement for the ST, STE or TT desktop. 
It provides more facilities than the built-in TOS desktops (especially  
the ones in TOS versions 1.*). 
  
TeraDesk is currently the only open-souce desktop available for 16-bit
and 32-bit  Atari computers.  Developers' goal has  been  to  maintain 
TeraDesk as a small, simple, fast and reliable desktop, which would be 
functional in the  modern multitasking  environments and  all flavours 
and versions of TOS-compatible operating  system(s),  and yet to keep, 
as much as reasonable, familiarity with the original TOS desktop. 

TeraDesk is NOT intended  to be a direct replacement for the excellent 
but  resources-demanding desktops like  Thing or Jinnee,  but  instead
is designed to be used  where  disk space or  system memory  and speed 
limitations (or price) make the use of those fine desktops impractical
(e.g. TeraDesk's  size and memory usage is currently only about 1/3 to 
1/2 of Jinnee's in a similar setup). 

TeraDesk  was  initially  developed  by  Wout Klaren. Version 1.41 was  
released in 1994 and here the development stopped for some time.  
  
Version  1.42 was the first one published (in the year 2002) under the  
GPL.  
  
Version 2.0  was an  adaptation by Henk Robbers  to modern AES's (like  
N.AES,  XaAES  & MagiC).

Version  2.3  was  the first result of joined efforts  of Henk Robbers
and  Djordje Vukovic, comprising a number of new features.  
  
Versions  3.* are the result of continued cooperation of H.Robbers and  
Dj.Vukovic;  they are a significant  further improvement of TeraDesk's  
functionality, the program having undergone an extensive redesign.  
  
  
The program may  be  copied and distributed freely  provided  that the 
terms of the GPL (see accompanying file COPYING) are respected. If the  
program is  distributed  by a PD library,  only the  costs of the disk
and distribution may be recovered.

@{U}1.2.1  Hardware requirements                                  TeraDesk@{u}  
  
Tera Desktop  can  be  used on any Atari ST series  computer and their  
offspring, TT, Falcon, Hades, Milan or emulators. It uses about 200 to 
300 KB of memory (depending on the complexity of configuration). 

If a computer has TT-RAM or Alt-RAM installed,  it is  recognized  and 
used by Tera Desktop.

Although  Tera Desktop can be used without the aid of a hard disk, the  
use of one is strongly recommended.  On machines without  a hard disk, 
but with enough memory,  a reset-proof RAM-disk can be used to contain
TeraDesk files, which will speed statup considerably.  

It should be noted that Tera Desktop is not  well optimized for use on
machines with only one floppy drive and no hard disk.  File copying in 
TeraDesk is done file-by-file, which, when copying files from one disk
to another on a machine with only one drive,  will mean a lot of  disk 
swapping. 

Tera Desktop has not been tested with ROM-port cartridges which behave
as drive 'c' (lowercase C). It can be expected that such 'drive'  will 
not be recognized, or that other problems may occur.

@{U}1.2.2 TOS Version compatibility                               TeraDesk@{u}  
  
Tera  Desktop should work with all existing versions of  TOS but it is  
very  much  more  useful  with  versions  1.04 (also known as 1.4) and  
above. There are several reasons for this, because in TOS version 1.04  
and above:  
  
- Folders can be renamed.  
  
- The  file processing routines are  very much  better and enable more  
facilities to be used.  
  
- GEM  programs   (including  Tera  Desktop  itself)  can  be  started  
automatically after booting.  
  
- There are significant bugs in TOS 1.0 and TOS 1.02 (1.2)  
  
- Functionality  of  Tera Desktop is reduced  with  TOS versions older  
than 1.04 (1.4) because of limitations on the size of menus.  
  
Since Version 2  TeraDesk  runs in modern  multitasking  environments,  
such as  MagiC,  TOS with Geneva,  Mint with N.Aes,  XaAES,  MyAES  or 
Atari AES 4.1.  It can run with  memory protection;  however,  in such
environments  problems  may  occur  with  some  incorrectly-programmed
or set AV-protocol clients  which can cause  TeraDesk to crash  if run 
with memory protection. See The AV protocol. 
  
TeraDesk 3* was tested on a number of system configuration, including:  
  
TOS 1.00 (RAM-loaded)  
  
TOS 1.02 + Mint 1.15.12 + AES 4.1 / N.Aes 2.0 / XaAES 0.970

TOS 4.04  
TOS 4.04 + Mint 1.15.12 + AES 4.1 / N.Aes 2.0 / XaAES 0.970  
  
Milan TOS 4.09 + MiNT 1.15.12 + N.Aes 1.2 / XaAES  
  
KAOS TOS  
  
MagiC 6.0 + NVDI 5.0   
MagiC 6.1 + NVDI 4.11  
MagiC 6.2 + NVDI 4.11  
  
The program is  supposed to work  (with some restrictions) on TOS 1.0,
bat the last versions of TeraDesk much  tested with it. Possibility of 
encountering  hitherto  undetected problems with this  TOS version  is 
suspected.

A  problem  was  encountered  related  to  mouse clicks on the desktop  
icons  when  TeraDesk  was  running in TOS 2.06 (only). An attempt was  
made  to  cure  this,  but  it  is  not  sure  yet whether it has been  
completely successful. Similar problem may exist in TOS 3.06. 
  
Change  of  screen  resolution works with various success in different  
AESses  (generally  supported with AES 4 versions only), e.g. in TOS +  
Geneva  or  TOS  +  Mint  +  AES4.1  it works perfectly; in some other  
environments it doesn't work so well, or not at all.  

TeraDesk  makes  several  inquires  trying  to determine TOS- and AES-  
versions  and  their  capabilities and limitations. If some version of  
TOS  or  AES  is  not  able to answer these queries, TeraDesk tries to  
make guesses  which  may  not  always be correct.  It is also possible  
that  incorrect  answer to an inquiry is supplied by TOS/AES, in which  
case TeraDesk  may  work  with unnecessary limitations  or else try to  
activate features which may not work. 

If TeraDesk is used with the new AESses currently being developed (e.g
XaAES or MyAES,  occasional unwanted behaviour  may occur  because  of
some features of these AESes  which are not yet fully functional. Such
issues usually get resolved with new releases of the AESses.

If TeraDesk is used on an emulator,  some of its  functionality may be
lost because of sometimes incomplete emulation. Such cases may include
e.g not  recognizing certain keyboard key codes,  or not being able to 
show  directories in 'unsorted' order.

It  is  recommended that you use Tera Desktop in high or medium screen  
resolution.  When  used  in  low (ST-low) resolution, it may work with  
some   restrictions,   depending   on  TOS  version,  because  of  the  
limitation  (imposed by the older versions of the AES)  on the size of 
menus (small screen buffer size).  This limitation  is met by removing 
some menu items when insufficient screen buffer size is detected (this 
should never happen EXCEPT in ST-low and ST-medium resolution):  
  
- In TOS 1.04 and older, menu separator bars are removed;  
  
- In TOS 1.02 and older, some menu items are removed, i.e:  
  
       -Delete...    
       -Print...   
       -View unsorted
       -Reverse order   
       -Copy disk...   
       -Show size   
       -Show date    
       -Show time    
       -Show attributes   
       -Set program types...   
       -Window options...   
       -Video options...   
       -Save as...  
       
Configuration items set by removed menu items  can still be set in the
configuration  file.  These  options  are  also  still  available  via 
Keyboard shortcuts. See also Desk preferences...      
   
In ST-High resolution there should not be any problems related to menu 
size in any old TOS version. See also TOS Version compatibility.  
  
If  TeraDesk  is to be used exclusively in high screen resolutions and  
long-file-names-capable   environment,   length   of   the  scrollable  
filename  and   pathname  fields   (see  Scrolled text fields)  can be  
increased  in  the  dialogs.  TeraDesk uses these fields in such a way  
that  it is  safe to use a resource editor and  increase the widths of  
the  relevant  dialogs  and  scrollable  fields,  until  they suit the  
user's  esthetic  and  other requirements.  Note that lengths of other  
alphanumeric  editable fields (i.e. filetype masks and search strings)  
should NOT be changed.

Screen resolution can be changed, depending on the AES and TOS version
used, through Video options... dialog.  This  feature does not work in
some AESses though; generally, it is effective only with some versions
of AES 4.

Although  TeraDesk  has been tested extensively, the program may still

@{U}2  Installation                                               TeraDesk@{u}  
  
Tera Desktop should be installed as follows:  
  
1. Create  a  folder called e.g. DESKTOP or TERADESK  anywhere on your  
floppy or hard disk  (or in a RAM disk) to hold Tera Desktop files. It
is also possible, although a bit untidy,  to put Tera Desktop into the
root directory of a disk volume.   

2. Copy into this folder the files:  
  
       DESKTOP.PRG  (if  you  intend  to use multitasking)  OR   
       DESKTOS.PRG  (if you  will  work  in  Single-TOS  only)    
       DESKTOP.RSC    
       ICONS.RSC    (if you will use monochrome icons) AND/OR  
       CICONS.PRG   (if your AES can support colour icons)   
  
Note  that  DESKTOP.PRG  will  work in single-TOS as well; DESKTOS.PRG  
just  saves  a  few  kilobytes of memory  by not containing code which 
is not relevant in  Single-TOS environment,  and by  having a somewhat 
limited support for the AV-protocol  (this limitation  is imposed only
for the sake of smaller program size).

If only DESKTOS.PRG is  to be used,  it may be renamed to  DESKTOP.PRG 
after copying,  but this is required only if  AV-protocol clients will 
be used.
  
You can  (but need not) also copy  into this folder  the configuration 
files TERADESK.INF and  TERADESK.PAL  from the  \EXAMPLES folder. Note
that these files  are set  for one particular computer  configuration, 
and may not  be appropriate for your setup  (Tera Desktop will attempt 
to  obey all that is  specified  in the configuration file,  no matter 
what the  actual  environment is,  e.g. the example  TERADESK.INF  has 
desktop icon for drives  A, B and C only,  and, if  that file is used, 
only those disk icons will be shown on the desktop).  Of course, these
files can be adjusted to any user's particular environment by defining
additional desktop and window icons, filetypes, applications, etc.

If you would feel more comfortable with  Tera Desktop  translated into 
some other language, you can replace DESKTOP.RSC  (and maybe ICONS.RSC 
and  CICONS.RSC)  with  translated  ones.  All text  strings  used  by 
Tera Desktop are located in DESKTOP.RSC  (except default filenames and 
a warning that DESKTOP.RSC can not be found).  It is thus possible  to 
completely  adapt Tera Desktop  to other languages by using translated
resource  files. Check the links on  Tera Desktop's home web page  for 
currently available translation(s).
  
3. If  you  use   ST-GUIDE,  copy  TERADESK.HYP and TERADESK.REF  from
the \DOC folder to the folder where your other .HYP files are.  If you
would like a translated  hypertext manual instead,  check the links on 
Tera Desktop's home web page for currently available translations, and
replace the English TERADESK.HYP and TERADESK.REF with translated ones
if they exist.
  
4. ONLY if you want  to convert  TeraDesk V2.*  configuration files to 
the new format of TeraDesk V3, you need to get also CFG2INF.PRG;  This  
utility  (not  included in  the  binary  distribution  but   available 
separately)  is basically a  tweaked compilation  of the  Tera Desktop 
itself, with  the  capability to read  only the old file format and to
write  only the new  format-  hence  an inappropriately large size  of
CFG2INF.PRG;  use it  only  to convert your old *.CFG files (use first  
Load Settings...  then  Save Settings as...), and  then promptly  dump  
it  to the trash bin. The created  .INF file  will have  the format of
TeraDesk 3.0 and there will be a couple  of warnings about  some minor
differences when it is read by a newer version of TeraDesk. 

See also Configuration files for more details.  
  
CFG2INF.PRG utility is not supported by the source code after TeraDesk 
Version 3.01.
  
After copying the necessary files, Tera Desktop can now  be started in 
the usual way by double clicking on its name.  

5.  Cooperation of Tera Desktop  with some other applications  will be
improved if it is announced  that certain protocols can be handled. In
order to do so, the following environment variables can be defined:

 AVSERVER=DESKTOP
 FONTSELECT=DESKTOP
 
These declare  TeraDesk as the AV-Server (see The AV Protocol)  and as
the font-selector (see The FONT Protocol). In Single-TOS configuration
these protocols can be used by some accessories (such as ST-Guide); in
multitasking configurations they can be used  by concurrently  running
applications. See also Supported Protocols.

The manner of declaration of environment variables depends on variants 
of the OS and utilities used.
  
6. It is convenient to set TeraDesk to start automatically  at  system
boot. If you have TOS version 1.04 (also known as TOS 1.4)  or higher, 
you can set it up for that by  installing TeraDesk  as  an application
and changing its boot status from 'Normal' to 'Auto'. Remember to save
desktop configuration after this.  As from now on TeraDesk  will  take 
over all desktop tasks, prior to saving the desktop configuration  all
other applications  should be deinstalled,  all unneeded icons removed 
from the desktop and all windows closed. This is not required but will 
reduce  the size of  DESKTOP.INF  (or NEWDESK.INF)  and will also free 
some memory. 
  
If  you  have  TOS version 1.0 or 1.02  you must use a program such as  
STARTGEM to run DESKTOP from an AUTO folder.  
  
If  you  use  Atari  AES 4.1,  you  can  put  something similar to the  
following directive into your GEM.CNF file:  
    
 shell path\to\TeraDesk\desktop.prg  
  
Then,  the  built-in desktop of AES 4.1 will  not be loaded at startup  
and  TeraDesk  will  run  as  the  desktop  instead. Beside being more  
elegant,  this  also  saves  some  memory.

If you use Geneva, N.AES, XaAES or MyAES,  you should in a similar way 
specify TeraDesk as the default shell in the appropriate places in the  
configuration files  of these  AESses  (i.e. in   GEM.CNF,  N_AES.CNF,
XA_EXEC.SCL and MYAES.CNF respectively). 
    
If  you  use  MagiC,  TeraDesk  should be specified as a shell via the  
#_SHL directive in MAGX.INF, as something similar to:

 #_SHL PATH\TO\TERADESK\DESKTOP.PRG 
  
7. Some versions of AES (e.g. Geneva 4) declare themselves  as capable
of handling colour  icons, but that capability  doesn't seem  to work. 
In such cases,  CICONS.RSC  file should be removed, and  TeraDesk will 
fall back to  monochrome icons.  Colour icons file can also be removed 
in other  environments  if there  is a need  to preserve  as much free 
memory as possible.

8. The icon files supplied contain basic sets of icons only.  Users can 
add icons at will, or use other icon files (for example, one can rename 
DESKICON.RSC and/or  DESKCICN.RSC  used  by the built-in desktop of TOS 
to ICONS.RSC and CICONS.RSC respectively, and use them with TeraDesk).

TeraDesk, since  V2.0, handles icons by name, not by index. Icons with 
the following names (or their translated equivalents) should always be 
present in the icons resource file(s):

 FLOPPY, HARD DISC, TRASH, PRINTER, FOLDER, FILE, APP

9. Some  aspects of  Tera Desktop  can be  (or may be  in the  future)
controlled through the environment variable TERAENV.  Its value should
consist of uppercase-letter flags. Currently only flag 'D' is used, as 
in:

 TERAENV=D

which to some extent controls the visual appearance of dialog objects.

If  you  select a second object while the first is still selected, the 
first  is  deselected  -  UNLESS  you  held  down  [Shift]  key  while 
selecting them; in that way you can select several objects. 
  
Another  way  of  selecting  several  objects  at once is to place the 
mouse  arrow  to  the  left of one of them and then hold down the left 
mouse  button.  Then,  if you move the mouse, a box will form in which 
you  can enclose other objects. When you release the mouse button, all 
the  enclosed  objects  are selected. Note that all the objects in the 
box  are  selected,  even though not all are visible. This is relevant 
if you scroll the contents of a window at the same time.  
 
3. We shall also refer to 'Opening' a file.  This generally means that 
you  place  the  mouse  cursor on the file (in a directory) and double 
click  with  the  left mouse button. Files can also be opened by first 
selecting  them,  and  then  selecting  'Open' from the '@{'File' link "Menu title: File"}' 
menu.  
 
4. We  shall  refer to keys  with square brackets enclosing the symbol 
written on the key itself. e.g. [Return], [Q] etc. 
  
5. Sometimes  we  mention  'masks'.  A  mask  is a sequence of symbols 
which  may or may not match a file name. Masks contain the symbols '*' 
and  '?'  as  well  as the standard symbols which may appear in a file 
name. 
  
'*' stands for any character or run of zero or more characters so that:  
  
A*B matches AB, AAB, ACB, AAAB, ACCB, ABCB etc. A* matches A,   
AB,AAA,ABC,ABCD etc.  
  
'?' stands for any single character:  
  
A?B matches AAB, ACB, A B etc.  

In Single-TOS, the default catch-all mask is usually '*.*';  in multi-
tasking environments with  looser restrictions on names  it is usually
just '*'. See also Set mask...
  
6. Most menu items  and dialog buttons can be selected with a keyboard 
key  (or  key  combination)  as  well  as  with the mouse.

@{U}3.2  Types of program files                                   TeraDesk@{u}  
  
Several types of programs (applications) can be encountered.  
  
The  type  of  a  given  program  depends  on how it is written and is  
beyond  your  control;  usually  the type of a program is indicated by  
its extension, but be warned, this is not always so.  
  
The types are:  
  
             Type  Usual       Description  
                   extensions  
  
        1.   GEM   PRG, APP    Program uses GEM and does not require  
                               parameters.  
  
        2.   GTP   GTP         Program   uses   GEM   and   requires  
                               parameters;  the GTP extension is not  
                               recognised in standard desktop.  
  
        3.   TOS   TOS         Program does not use GEM and does not  
                               require parameters.  
  
        4.   TTP   TTP         Program does not use GEM but requires  
                               parameters.  
  
        5.   ACC   ACC         Accessory program  
  
Parameters  are  items  of  data, often a file name, which are sent to  
the program as you invoke it.  
  
The  standard  desktop  recognizes  the last three programs from their  
extension  and  reacts  appropriately  when  you  open  them. With TTP  
programs  it  displays a dialog box in which you can enter parameters.  
Tera  Desktop  in addition recognises the GTP extension and displays a  
dialog box for such programs.  
  
While  it is possible to rename program files giving them an extension  
which  does  not  properly  reflect  their  type, this is inadvisable.  
Nevertheless  Tera  Desktop  will  allow  you  to define the type of a  
program.  
  
Thus,  If  a  GEM  or  TOS type program file is given the .GTP or .TTP  
extension,  anything you enter in the parameter dialog box is ignored.  
Conversely  a GTP or TTP type program which has not been provided with  
the parameters it expects, may not work properly.

@{U}3.3  Running a program                                        TeraDesk@{u}  
  
There  are  several  ways  in  which  you  can invoke (run, execute) a  
program both from the standard desktop and from Tera Desktop.  
  
1.  Perhaps the most common method of starting a program is to open it 
by  double  clicking  on  its  name  or  icon in a directory window. A 
parameter dialog box is displayed for GTP and TTP files. 
  
2.  Another method is to set up an icon for the program on the desktop 
so that it is started when you double click on it. 
  
3.  Third  method  is to install the program as an application, and to 
set  up  a  function  key  (in 'Set applications...'  dialog)  so that 
the program is started when the key is pressed. 
  
4.  Fourth  method  is to install the program as an application and to 
set it  as  'boot'  or (in TeraDesk) as 'autostart';  in TeraDesk, all 
programs  so  marked  will be automatically started sequentially after 
TeraDesk is started (see Set applications...). 
  
5.  Yet   another  method,  is  to   double  click  on  an  associated 
'Application  Document' file (see Set applications...). The program is 
started  and  the  name  of  the  application  document is passed as a 
parameter.  
 
6.  Finally  you  can  drag  an  application document (see above) to a 
program  icon.  As  long as the application document file name matches 
one  of  the program's application masks (see Set applications...), it 
will be as if you had double clicked on the file as in method 5. 
  
Note  that  Accessory  programs  cannot be started from the desktop in  
single-TOS  in  any  of  these  ways;  they  can  only  be  started at
boot time and activated by selecting their appropriate menu item.

However, it makes sense in single-TOS to install  an accessory program
as the application  for some document types,  if that  accessory knows 
of VA_START message (see The AV Protocol), and if the desktop can send
this message.  Such an application is  e.g. ST-Guide  (when run as  an 
accessory),  which may be  installed  as the application  for the .HYP 
files. 

In a multitasking environment a  question exists of  whether or not to
start multiple instances of the same program/application. Tera Desktop
resolves this issue in the following way:

- If the selected program is not running, it is, of course, started.

- If the selected program/application  is already running, then:
  . If a document is selected, as in methods #5 and 6 above,  its name
    is always sent to the already-running application.
  . In all other cases  Tera Desktop  asks  whether  to start  another
    instance of  the same application.  If a confirmatory  response is
    given,  a new insance  of the application  will be started and any
    parameters present  will be sent to it.  If a negative response is
    given,  any parameters  existing will  be  passed  to  the running
    application.

With  this  item,  a selected object can be opened. The meaning of the  
term depends on the type of the selected object.  
  
If the  selected  object is a  disk volume  or a folder,  a  directory
window is opened on that object  
  
If  the  object  is  a  file, and that filetype has been assigned as a  
document  type  to an application, that application is started and the  
selected file is opened.  
      
If the object  is an executable file (program), it is started  (or the
command line parameters  are sent to an  already-running  program, see 
Running a program).

If the object is a symbolic link, it is always  followed to the target
object,  and the action  appropriate  for the target is commenced,  as 
above. 

If the object is neither a program  nor a file which has been assigned 
to an application, a dialog with opening options is displayed:  
  
- Selecting 'Show' opens a Text window with the selected file.
  
- Selecting 'Edit' calls an installed editor to open the file. 
 
- Selecting 'Run' causes the file to be treated as an executable file,
  although such filetype has not been marked as a program type  in the
  Set program options...  dialog.  The program type dialog  appears in 
  which a program type can be set for the selected file (assignment is 
  not permanent). The file is then opened (started) as a program. 
  
- Selecting 'With' opens The listbox dialog from which  an application  
  can  be  selected  to open  the file  with.  Selection  can  be made
  either  by single-clicking  upon an application  in the listbox, and
  then by clicking 'OK' or by double-clicking upon  an application, in
  which case the dialog is immediately closed.  If the  setup for  the 
  selected  application  is edited,  the  object's file(type)  can  be 
  assigned as a documenttype for this application,  in which case this
  file type  will  in  the future  always  be opened  with  the chosen 
  application. 

This dialog is  also opened  if an object is  opened while holding the
[Alternate] key pressed. 

  If no objects  are selected,  a dialog opens  in which  the path and   
name of the object can be entered in the '@{"scrolled editable field" link "Scrolled text fields"}'. TeraDesk tries to divine the type of the   
item  so  specified:  a  file,  a folder, an application or a document  
assigned  to an application, and acts accordingly, as presented above.  
If  an  application  is  specified  in  the  dialog,  its name  can be  
followed by a command tail (after a blank character).  
  
Name of the last object opened and the trailing command  are preserved 
in the dialog  across calls of this dialog,  until another application
has been activated.

When  this  item  is selected, Tera Desktop displays information about  
an object (or objects) you have previously selected:  
  
1. If the selected object is a file, its name, path, the time and date   
it  was last modified and the number of bytes in it will be displayed.  
The  name  of  the  file, access date and time can be changed. You can  
also   set/unset   the  Write  Protect,  Archive,  Hidden  and  System  
attributes   of  the  file.  If  the  file  is  write-protected,  this  
attribute  must be reset before attempting to change other information  
related  to  that  file.  If time and date fields are cleared, current  
time and date will be set for the file.  
  
2. If the selected object is a folder, its name, the time  and date of   
it  creation,  the number of files and folders in it and the number of  
bytes  used  will  be  displayed.  Folder  attributes  (Write Protect,  
Archive,  Hidden and System) are also displayed, although they are not  
settable  in TOS (they can be set e.g. on a floppy disk manipulated in  
Windows  on  a  PC).  With TOS version 1.04 and above, the folder name  
can be changed.  

3. If the selected object is a symbolic link, its  name, the time  and 
date of creation  and its size will be displayed.  File attributes are
also  displayed,  but changing  them will  NOT affect the link itself.
The path and name of the object  the link is referencing  is displayed,
and it can be edited. Note that if this item is changed, the  symbolic
link will in fact be deleted and a new one created.

4. If  the  selected  object  is  a disk volume, the drive letter, the  
volume  label,  the  number  of files and folders on it, the number of  
used  and  available bytes, the total free space on it and the cluster  
size  will be displayed. If the disk is empty, it is possible that the  
total  space  and  the  free space will be different; this is due to a  
bug in TOS.  
  
5.  If  no  object  has  been  selected,  Tera  Desktop  will  display 
information  on the disk volume of the top directory window, if any is 
open. If there are no open windows, this menu item is disabled. 
  
  
It  is  possible  to  select more than one object before invoking this  
menu  item;  content  of  the  dialog  box  will change to show fields  
appropriate for the selected item types in turn.  
  
Selecting  'All' will cause setting of file attributes and/or date and  
time   on   all  selected  file  items.  Selecting  this  button  when  
information  on  a  folder is shown, will cause setting of attributes,  
date  and  time on all files in the folder and its subfolders, but the  
data  for  the folders themselves will not be affected. This action is  
confirmed  by  the  appearance  of   a  dialog  in which  the user can  
select  whether  only file attributes should be set, or time and date,  
or both.  
  
Selecting  'OK'  will  cause  setting  of  all  displayed data for the  
currently displayed item.  
  
Selecting  'Skip'  will  cancel  all  changes  made  for the currently  
displayed item and show the next selected item.  
  
Selecting  'Abort'  will  cause closing the dialog and cancellation of  
all changes.  

Info... dialog  can  also  appear  on  the  screen  as a result of the 
Format disk...  operation  (to show  the  configuration  of  the newly
formatted floppy disk) and also as a result of the Search... operation
(to found show item(s)  which match the search criteria;  in this last
case  the dialog may contain  additional data  showing  the results of
the string search in the shown file.

Tera  Desktop  has  the capability  to compare contents of files. When 
this menu  item  is selected,  a dialog appears  in which the user can 
enter the names of two  files to  be  compared. If this  menu item  is 
selected  when  either  one  or  two files  are  already  selected  in 
directory windows,  the names of those files will  be entered into the 
dialog. 

If [Insert] key is  pressed while  the cursor is  in any  of  the  two 
fields in the dialog, the file selector will appear can help in making
the selection.

Clicking 'OK' in the dialog starts the comparison.  When a difference 
between the contents  of  the  two  files  is  detected, the contents 
of both files near the detected difference is displayed in the dialog
as well as the offset  of the found  difference from the start of the
first file. Note that instead of any 'null' characters  substitutions 
will be shown (the [Del] character,  usually represented  by  a small  
triangle,  will be used). 
   
File   comparison   function   tries  to  use  some  intelligence  and  
resynchronize further comparison  in  the files  after a difference is  
found.  Width of the resynchronization window  can be  entered  in the 
dialog, in the range of 1 to 99 characters.  Smaller window sizes will 
set Tera Desktop to detect  small differences  closely following  each 
other. Larger window sizes will set Tera Desk resynchronize comparison 
after a large block of difference(s).

This  function  completely reads both files into memory, and may be of  
limited use on machines with minimum RAM.

When  this  item  is selected, a dialog  appears  in  which  the  name 
pattern (name or name mask)  to   be  searched  for  in  the  selected
folders  and / or disk volumes is  specified.  
  
File/folder name or name pattern (mask)  must always be  specified. If 
it is not, search will not commence. 
   
Date and size limits are optional; if left blank, TeraDesk will ignore   
them.  
  
String  to  be  searched  for is optional. If left blank, Tera Desktop  
will only search  for files  and folders matching the pattern mask. If  
any  string is specified, Tera Desktop will search for it in the files  
which match the name pattern.  
  
If a match is found the Info... dialog is opened showing specification
of  the  found  object.  If  a  search  string has been  entered, file
contents surrounding the found string are displayed;  to  save  space,
the  string  itself  is replaced by [...]  so that more  of  the  text
preceding  and  following the string can be displayed. Note  that some
characters  which  would  corrupt  the  formatting   of the  displayed
text are replaced by a substitute- the [Del] character  which  in most 
fonts is represented by a small triangle.  
  
Note  that  each  file  searched  for strings is first completely read  
into  memory. Therefore, searching for strings in large files  may not 
be possible,  depending  on  the  amount  of  free memory. If a search 
string is not  specified,  search  will  involve  only file and folder 
names, without  actually reading  any files, and  memory will not be a
limitation.  

Search operation can be interrupted by pressing the [Esc] key.

- If files are printed, one of three printing modes can be selected:

  .Text mode:  files printed will be  considered  as text  files,  and
   carriage returns/line feeds  will  be  inserted  upon reaching  the
   specified  printer line length;  lines longer than this length will 
   be wrapped.  If a file being printed  is recognized  as a  program,
   printing mode will be temporarily switched to hex-dump (see below).

  .Hex-dump: files will be printed formatted identically  as in a text 
   window in hex mode.
   
  .Raw data: files will  be sent to the printer  as they are,  without 
   any modification.  This mode is convenient for printing print-files
   created by some application. 
   
In  the  current  version of TeraDesk,  all printing  is done  through 
GEMDOS, using Cprnout() function.
   
If you  are  running TeraDesk in low or medium  screen resolution  and
TOS 1.0, this menu item may not be visible, because of the limitations
in this TOS version.  In that case it will be available only through a
keyboard shortcut.

When  this  item is selected and a floppy drive icon is also selected, 
a  physical copy, sector by sector, of the floppy will be made. Before 
attempting  actual  copying, a check will be made to see if the target 
and  the  source disk have the same format. Therefore, both disks must 
have  valid  boot  sectors containing the information on the number of 
sides, tracks and sectors. 
  
For copying, a buffer of the size specified in Copy and print...  will
be used.  
  
If  this  operation  is  used  in a multitasking environment  (Mint or 
Magic),  an attempt  is made  to lock the  floppy drive  device before

When this item is selected  and a floppy drive icon  is also selected,  
the dialog of the Floppy format function appears on the screen.  
  
The dialog offers many options:  
  
4 densities:  
     Single sided    (SSDD)  
     Double sided    (DSDD)  
     High density    (DSHD)  
     Extra density   (DSED)  
  
For each density chosen, further parameters  can  be specified,  which
will modify the basic format  (editable  only  after  selectig a basic
format):  
  
    number of sides  
    number of tracks  
    number of sectors per tracks  
    directory size  
    volume label  
      
If  this  operation  is  used  in a multitasking environment  (Mint or 
Magic),  an  attempt  is  made  to lock the floppy drive device before 
commencing formatting.  If it fails  (e.g. if the device is already in
use), formatting can not be commenced.
      
Note  that  this item might not be present in the copy of TeraDesk you

1: return to the standard desktop   
2: return to the AES fallback desktop (e.g. Geneva, N.Aes,  AES 4.1 or 
   XaAES)  
3: shut down the computer completely  
   
If option 3 is selected in a multitasking environment  the appropriate 
shutdown procedure is activated. 
   
Note  that  only  a  very  simple  sequence of  shutdown operations is 
performed:  shutdown is invoked by shel_write(...) function, which may 
not  have  any  effect in older versions of the AES. After shel_write, 
and  after  waiting for several seconds, if TeraDesk is still alive, a 
Shutdown() is initiated (in restart mode), but only if Mint is present. 
If TeraDesk is still alive after -that-, a brute-force reset is done. 
   
If a  more  sophisticated  shutdown  is required, an external Shutdown 
utility should be used.

When this option is ticked, files and folders in directory windows are
shown as icons. When the option is not ticked, they are shown as text. 
  
In  text mode,  item size in bytes, the creation date and time and the 
file attributes can be shown as well as the file name. 
  
Which  of  the  above  are  shown is determined by the Show options in 
this menu. 

Note:  in earlier versions of TeraDesk  there were two menu items  for
controlling  the appearance  of  directory windows: 'Show as text' and
'Show as icons'. As one of them was in fact redundant,  'Show as text'
was removed in order to minimize complications created by limited menu
size in old versions of TOS (see TOS Version compatibility).

When this option  is selected,  TeraDesk will  attempt to optimize the 
use of screen area when displaying directory windows. This means that:

- In text mode (see Show as icons) the directories may be displayed in 
  one or several  columns,  depending on  screen width  and the length
  of directory lines,  which, in turn, depends on selection of visible 
  fields  (see  Show options...).  This options  is  especially usable
  when it is needed  to display as many items in a directory window as
  possible.  Choice of a smaller font for directory windows  increases
  the number of columns that can be displayed on the screen. 
  
- In icon mode the directories are displayed with icons rearranged  to
  fit the current  widths  of  the windows.  Horizontal  scrolling  of
  the windows is not possible, nor needed.
  
When this options is deselected:

- In text mode directories are displayed in one column only.

- In icon mode the  directories are displayed  with icons  arranged to 
  fit the whole width of the screen.  Horizontal slider can be used to 
  scroll  the window to  left or right  in order to make  some  of the
  items visible.
  
A note: it can be  expected that  manipulation of windows  (scrolling,
changing size,  etc.)  will  be  somewhat  slower  when  display is in 
the  text mode  and  this option is selected.  On the  contrary,  when
display is in icon mode,  window manipulation may be slower  when this
option is -not- selected.

               3.   Sort by creation date  
               4.   Sort by size  
               5.   View unsorted  
  
Items  are sorted in the ascending order. Note that, in 'Sort by size' 
and 'Sort by date' modes it is contrary to the TOS desktop which lists 
first the largest and newest files. See also Reverse order.
  
If  you  select  'View unsorted',  items are displayed in the order in 
which  they were stored on the disk; note that this is not necessarily 
the  same as  the order of  their creation,  but  depends also  on the 
history of additions and deletions in the particular directory. 
  
The mode selected applies to all open windows.  

If you  are  running TeraDesk in low or medium  screen resolution  and
TOS 1.0, 'View unsorted'  menu item may not be visible, because of the 
limitations in this TOS version.

The mode selected applies to all open windows.  

If you  are  running TeraDesk in low or medium  screen resolution  and

either  type  a  file  mask  or  select a mask from a predefined list. 
Double  clicking  on  a  mask  in  the  list  has the double effect of 
selecting the mask and exiting the box as if you selected 'OK'. 
  
It  is  also  possible  to  delete the mask which is selected, edit an 
existing mask or add a new one to the list. See The listbox dialog. 
  
The  selected  mask  ONLY  applies  to  the directory window  that was 
current (Top) when this item was selected.  See also Conventions.
 
Alongside a mask, four other masking options can be chosen.  
  
     Hidden              show hidden files  
     System              show system files  
     Subfolders          show subfolders  
     Parent              show the .. (parent) virtual folder  
       
These selections are global, i.e. they apply to ALL directory windows.

A complete filename can be specified  for the mask as well,  either by
entering it manually, or by selecting a name in a directory window and
then opening this dialog.

window  is  the  directory  window  of a folder, it is replaced by the 
window  of  the  directory which is one level higher. If the window is 
the  directory  window of a disk volume root, the window is closed. If 
the window is a text (viewer) window, it is closed. 

If an application has  signed-on itself as an  AV-protocol client, its

When  this  item  is  selected, the bottom window is moved to the top. 
This  is  particularly useful when one window is covered completely by 
others  for  you can view this hidden window without having to move or 
delete the windows which cover it. 

If an application has  signed-on itself as an  AV-protocol client, its
windows  can be included in the TeraDesk's  list  of windows;  in such 
cases, the 'Cycle windows' command  applies to the client's windows as 
well. Note that some AV-protocol clients send ^W as a simulation  of a
keyboard shortcut command to cycle windows.  This originated  from the
Gemini desktop which uses  ^W as the shortcut for  'Cycle windows' but
is not  very suitable for  an  environment with  configurable keyboard 
commands and may interfere with other defined keyboard shortcuts.

Parameters which can be set, either all manually, or by taking some of   
them from the name and location of a file selected in a window, are:  
  
- Application path:  
  Location of the application program can be entered or edited.  
  
- Application name:  
  Name of the application can be entered or edited.  
  
- Default command line:  
  You  may  wish  to  send  other parameters besides  a file name to a 
  program. If these are likely to vary from one call of the program to 
  another,  your  best plan  is  to invoke  the program by opening it. 
  However, if the other parameters  are constant,  you can set them up 
  in the 'Command line' field. 
  
  Whatever  you  write in the Command line will be sent to the program 
  when  you  invoke  it  by  double clicking  on  it or by dragging an
  application document to it. 
  
  The  symbols  %f, %n and %p have  a special meaning  when entered in 
  the command line: 
  
  %f - This is replaced by the path  (including drive, directory and 
  name) of the application file.  
  
  %F - Same as %f, however file names are converted to lower case.  

  %n - This is replaced by the application document file name.  
  
  %N - Same as %n, however file names are converted to lower case.  
  
  %p - This is replaced by the application document path.  
  
  %P - Same as %p, however path names are converted to lower case.  
   
- Local environment string  to be  passed to the application.  Several
  environment variables  can be  specified in this string,  using  the 
  format:  VAR1=VAL1 VAR2=VAL2  etc.  i.e.  assignments  separated  by 
  blanks but without blanks around '='. Note that this  capability may
  not be functional (yet) in XaAES, and may even cause a crash.
  
- Function key upon which the application can be started:  
  Numbers  1 to 10 correspond the the [F1] to [F10] keys  and 11 to 20 
  to the same keys with [Shift] held down. 
  
- Special use of the application.
  A second-level dialog opens  in which flags  for assigning a special 
  role to the application can be set.  One of the following roles  can
  be assigned to an application:
 
  . Editor              (only one application can be marked)
  . Viewer              (only one application can be marked)
  . Autostart           (more than one application can be marked)
  . Shutdown            (more than one application can be marked)
  . Resolution change   (only one application can be marked)
  . File search         (only one application can be marked)
  . Floppy format       (only one application can be marked)
  
  Applications specified for viewer, shutdown, resolution change, file
  search and floppy format will,  if specified,  substitute TeraDesk's 
  internal routines.
  
  Applications flagged as 'Autostart' are executed  automatically when
  TeraDesk starts.  There is  a delay of  a couple of seconds  between
  each application being started,  to allow the started application to
  configure itself, shrink used memory, etc.
  
  Applications flagged as 'Shutdown'  will execute  with a delay of 10
  seconds between them, when 'Shutdown' is selected  in the File menu.
  This (or these)  application(s),  if specified,  have to perform all
  activities needed for shutdown;  the internal  shutdown procedure of 
  TeraDesk will be disabled.
        
- Application program type:  
  A  second-level  dialog  (The program type dialog)  appears in which 
  you can set the type of application program. 
    
- List of assigned document types:  
  The listbox dialog appears in which a list of filetypes or filenames 
  which will be opened by this applications can be edited.  
 
  The  standard  TOS  desktop only allows you to specify one extension 
  which  is presumed  to be common to  all the  application documents. 
  Tera Desktop  is  much  more  flexible  and  allows  you  to specify
  several complete  file names  or masks in which you can include wild
  cards if you wish. 
 
  With document types  associated  to  an application, you can run the 
  program  and  at  the same time  pass  the  name  of the application 
  document to the program as a parameter. You do this by  double click
  on an application document whose file name matches the mask. 
  
  This  can be very  useful  and  save much time if, for instance, the 
  program  is an editor.  Just opening a document file will enable you
  to edit the document without the necessity of having to double click
  on the program and then enter the document file name by hand or from
  the file selector. 
  
  It is important to note that a file matching the mask on the list of 
  any of the programs cannot be printed or displayed  on the screen by 
  opening it  in the  normal way.  This merely  invokes the program to 
  which  you have  associated it.  However, this  may be  overriden by 
  holding down [Alternate] as you select it.

With  this  menu  option  you  can  determine which files Tera Desktop 
recognises  as  containing a program and set various other features. A 
dialog box is displayed in which you can: 
  
1.Toggle a flag which  indicates whether Tera Desktop  will wait for a 
keypress  after a TOS or TTP program has finished. This is useful when 
such  programs  write  something on the screen and you want to read it 
at leisure. 
  
2. Toggle  a  flag which indicates  whether Tera Desktop will redirect 
output to GEMDOS standard handle 2 to the screen. This is usefull when
you are using programs compiled with GNU C.  
 
3. Set  which  files  or file types contain programs.  A small listbox 
window  contains a list of file name masks; you can scroll the list or 
select  an  entry.  Any  file  which  matches  one  of  the  masks  is 
recognised  by  Tera  Desktop to be a program. You can add a new mask, 
edit  one  already  there  which  you  have selected or delete the one 
selected  by  clicking  on  the  appropriate  button.  

See The listbox dialog for more details. 
  
If  you  add  or  edit  a  mask, The program type  dialog box  will be 
shown  in  which  you  must define the file type and set the ARGV flag 
and other information for the program. 
  
If you  are  running TeraDesk in low or medium  screen resolution  and

You  can  use  this  menu  option  to install or change an icon on the 
desktop.  When  you  first  select  it,  a  mini-icon  appears  on the 
desktop;  you  can move this about the screen with your mouse till you 
release  the left mouse button; by then you will have placed it at the 
position  you  wish  the  new icon to be displayed (if you select this 
option  while  a  desktop  icon  is selected the mini icon will not be 
shown, and a dialog will open immediately). 
  
When  you  release  the  mouse  button,  The icon selector dialog  box 
appears.  You  can  define  the  type of icon and its actual design in 
this. There are three types of Icon each of which has a special use: 
  
1. Disk      Files dragged to this icon will be copied to the disk.  
  
2. Printer   Files dragged to this icon will be printed.  
  
3. Trashcan  Files dragged to this icon will be deleted.  
  
In addition there are many different designs of icon available.  
  
You  can  scroll through these different designs to select the one you 
prefer.  You  can  also  enter an identifying letter (for drive icons) 
and  a  title for the icon. Do not forget to exit with the 'OK' button 
(or Cancel if that is what you prefer). 
  
Note  that  icons representing programs and other types of file can be 
placed  on  the  desktop  simply by dragging them from their directory 
onto  the  desktop.  In these cases the form of the icon is decided by 
Tera  Desktop which determines it according to its nature. If a window 
icon  has  already  been  assigned  to  that  file  or filetype, it is 
preserved  when  dragged to the desktop. Subsequent changing of window 
icon assignments will not affect icons already placed on the desktop. 
  
Icons can be placed on the desktop only one at a time, but if you want
to change those already on the desktop, you can select more than one.

With  this  menu  item you can determine the way files and folders are 
displayed  when they are represented  as icons (see  Show as icons) in 
directory windows.  
 
When  you  select it, The listbox dialog is displayed. The first thing 
you must do is to select object type: either 'Files' or 'Folders'. 
  
The  dialog  box  contains a window  showing a list of  file or folder 
name  masks.  You  can scroll through these by clicking on the arrows. 
Each  mask  on  the  list  is  associated with an icon and any file or 
folder  whose  name  matches  the  mask  is depicted by the associated 
icon.  
 
You  can add new masks and icons to the list by selecting 'Add' when a 
new  dialog  box with  The icon selector dialog is displayed.  You can 
enter  a  mask  and  select an icon. You can also delete an entry from 
the list by selecting 'Delete' or edit it with 'Edit'. 
  
If  you  activate  this option while a file or folder is selected in a 
window, The icon-selector dialog will  immediately appear.  This gives 
you  a chance to assign icons in a way similar to that existing in the 
TOS desktop. Only one item at a time can be handled this way.

- Set the dialog box display mode:  
  Dialog boxes  can be drawn in  one of  two modes.  Each mode has its 
  advantages:  
  
     1. Flying (or buffered mode):  
       In this mode dialogs appear in boxes  which can be moved about
       the screen  by clicking on  and dragging a special button (the 
       'ear') in its top right corner. The screen  under a dialog box
       is saved in a  buffer.  It can thus be restored rapidly if the 
       box is moved.  This dialog display mode is  generally suitable
       for slower machines.
           
    2. Window mode: 
       In this mode dialogs appear in windows. This has the advantage
       that  you can  use  accessories  while  the box  is  displayed 
       and  can  move the dialog box  about the screen.  This display
       mode is somewhat slower than the 'flying' mode. 
  
  Note that dialog boxes displayed by other programs are not effected.  
    
- Determine the position of the dialog box:  
  There are two possibilities:  
  
    1. Under mouse:  
       Place the box  at a point  determined by the  position of the 
       mouse. This option is of most use when the display of the box 
       is  initiated by a key press.  It is thus possible to prevent 
       it from covering other objects.  
  
    2. Centered: 
       Centre the box on the screen in the standard way. However, if
       a dialog is  moved to  another  position  on the screen,  and 
       another dialog is opened from it, it will open in the current
       position, not in the centre of the screen. 
  
- Specify menu shortcuts:  
  Use the arrows for choosing a menu item, then fill out the key you
  want to use as shortcut for this menu.  
  . Plain keys are possible, just type the key.  
  . Combinations with CTRL are possible, prepend the key by ^  
  . Some of the special keys  can be used,  which should  be entered  
    in text form as TAB, BS, DEL and SP for the [Tab],  [Backspace],  
    [Delete] and [Space] keys respectively.  
  Note that, because  of the limitations  of the  scan codes  of the  
  Atari keyboards,  some key combinations  can not be differentiated  
  from some others, and some will be recognized as illegal.   
  
- Set the default tabsize:  
  
  The number of blank column  produced in a text window  when a 'Tab'  
  is encountered.  This is the global setting;  Tab size for each of   
  the Text windows can be set in the menu of that window.

box is displayed. In this you can: 
  
1. Toggle confirmation of copies and moves.  
  
2. Toggle confirmation of overwrites.  
  
3. Toggle confirmation of deletes.  
  
4. Toggle confirmation of print operations.  

5. Set whether links whould be followed  in copy and delete operations 
   or  whether  the  operations  should  be  performed  on  the  links
   themselves. 
  
6. Control whether The copy info dialog will appear.  
  
7. Control the printing  of headers  and separators  before/after each
   item being printed  
  
8. Set  the  size of the copy buffer.  This is an area of RAM which is 
   used  to  store  the  contents  of files  being copied. In general, 
   the larger  you set it,  the faster  will be  the copying  of large 
   files. 
  
9. Set printer line length; lines longer than this are wrapped.  
  
The  dialog  boxes  displayed  when  a  confirmation  is necessary are 
similar to those in the standard desktop.

box is displayed in which you can:  
 
1. Select a fill pattern for the desktop background

and its size. Currently, only monospaced fonts are considered. 

Number of available patterns is limited to eight. There is no limit on
the number of colours,  but selection will be limited to the number of
colours available in the current video mode. In order for the patterns
to be visible in the selector boxes,  colours other than white must be
selected.

Some  or  many  of the  facilities  presented in this dialog might not 
work  in  certain types of environment. It depends highly on the video 
hardware and the OS on which TeraDesk is running.
  
- Standard resolution: 
  
  Choose one of the 6 standard ST/TT resolutions.  
  
  Do not  take  this action  lighthearted:  when you  press  OK  and a 
  resolution different from the current one has  been  selected,  your
  computer  will  initiate  a  shutdown  and  resolution change action 
  without any further confirmation. 
  
  Pressing the OK button will ALWAYS cause  redraw of TeraDesk desktop
  and  its  windows.  This  can  be  useful  to  recover  from  screen 
  corruption which might have been caused by a misbehaving program.
  
- Options: 
  
    1. Toggle a switch to save the palette. If this facility is  
       switched on, the palette is saved when a program is run and  
       restored when it finishes.  
       This is useful if the program changes the palette without   
       restoring it itself. See Configuration files.  
  
    2. Toggle a switch to activate/deactivate a blitter chip. If   
       blitter chip is not available this option should be disabled.  
      
    3. Toggle a switch to activate/deactivate overscan mode.  
       Currently this options is compatible only with the original   
       Overscan / Lacescan hardware hack for the ST range and switches   
       ON/OFF the appropriate signal on the keyboard ACIA chip.  
  
It  can  be  noted  that  some  free space is available in the Options 
frame.  This  was  left on purpose, to allow for additional options if 
they prove to be needed. 

If you  are  running TeraDesk in low or medium  screen resolution  and
TOS 1.0, this menu item may not be visible, because of the limitations
in this TOS version. 

If an external utility is marked for screen resolution,  Video options
dialog will not appear. In such case the external utility will have to 
do all the work on changing the video mode.

invoked through diverse menu items, depending on the use: 
 
Set mask...   to  maintain  a  list  of  predefined filetype masks for 
TeraDesk's Directory windows 
  
Set applications... to maintain a list of installed applications   
  
Set program types... to maintain a list of  executable file types  
  
Set window icons... to  maintain lists of  icons assigned  to  certain   
filenames or filetypes or folder names  
  
Set document types... to maintain lists of  document types assigned to 
applications.  This is  a second-level dialog and it is activated from 
the Set applications... dialog. 
  
Listbox content  is manipulated by five buttons  (Add,  Edit,  Delete,   
Up-arrow and Down-arrow).   
  
Add:  opens  a second-level dialog  to fill-in data  for an item which 
will be added to the list at the highlighted  position.  Depending  on 
the type of item being added,  an appropriate dialog is opened.
  
Edit:  opens  a  second-level  dialog  to  edit  data  for an  already 
existing  item.  Depending on  the  type  of  item  being  edited,  an 
appropriate dialog is opened.
  
Delete: deletes the highlighted item in the list.  
  
Up-arrow: moves an item up in the list. 
  
Down-arrow: moves an item down the list.  
  
The  purpose  of  the  last  two  buttons is to enable editing of item 
order.  TeraDesk searches all lists starting from the beginning, until 
the   first   match  is  found.  It  may  be  desirable  to   put  the 
often-needed items nearer to the top of the list, for faster response. 
  
Items  can  be added (or edited) in all of TeraDesk's lists, except in 
the lists of  document-types  assigned  to applications, in two  ways:
either  you  can  manually enter all data related to an item,  or  you
can select  an item in a directory window or on the desktop, and  then
open  the  desired   dialog  to  modify  the  default  settings  which 
TeraDesk   assigned  for  an  item  added  to  a  list  in  this  way. 
Document-types  asigned  to  applications can be edited only manually, 
being in the second-level of dialog (i.e. they  can not be selected in 
a window).

In  manu  cases it is needed to enter a long text (usually a path or a 
long  filename)  into a dialog  text field. However, practical  length 
of  a  dialog  text  field  is  limited  by  dialog  size  and  screen 
resolution. 
  
To  overcome  this  difficulty a new object type has been implemented: 
input  field which is able to receive more characters then can be made 
visible.  Whether  parts of the text are invisible is indicated by the 
characters  '<' and '>' appearing around the field. Use the [Left] and 
[Right]  cursor  keys  to scroll back and forth in the fields. In this 
way names of up to about 130 characters can be entered. 
  
Pressing the [Insert] key while the cursor is in a scrolled text field   
opens the file-selector. Selected file or folder name is inserted into   
the field at cursor position.  
  
Dialog  fields  referring  to  file  names  will  have  a  8+3 form if 
TeraDesk  is  run  in  an environment which does not support long file 
names.  In  the  opposite  case  (i.e. if Mint or MagiC are detected), 
filename forms will be longer and of the scrolled text field type.

@{U}4.15 Rendering of dialog objects                              TeraDesk@{u}  
      
Some object types  in  TeraDesk  dialogs,  such as the  circular radio 
buttons, the checkbox buttons, titled frames,  buttons with underlined 
text, etc. are only supported by some versions of the AES. In order to
display  them on the screen,  the  following approach  is adopted:  An
inquiry is made  to the AES whether WHITEBAK flag in the resource file
is supported;  if it is, TeraDesk  assumes that the  AES can  draw all 
those  objects, and  lets  the AES do that.  In  the   opposite  case,
TeraDesk  draws the objects. A positive side of this approach is  that
the appearance of those objects in TeraDesk  is in  style with objects
drawn  by  the  AES in  other applications.  A negative  side  is that
some objects  drawn by some AESses look uglier than they  would be had
TeraDesk drawn  them.  Another  drawback  is  that  e.g. Geneva  marks 
relevant objects  in  a different  way  than e.g. Magic or N.AES; that
is not recognized by TeraDesk and so these capabilities of  Geneva are 
left unused.

Behaviour of TeraDesk can be controlled in this matter through the use
of  TERAENV environment variable.  If it contains character 'D' (as in
'Draw'),  TeraDesk will draw  these extended object types,  regardless
of whether an AES supports  them.   See also: Installation

@{U}5.2  The icons files                                          TeraDesk@{u}  
  
TeraDesk  holds  its  images  of  icons  in  the files named ICONS.RSC 
and/or  CICONS.RSC; the first file should contain monochrome icons and 
the  second  one colour icons. These files should reside in teraDesk's 
folder (see Installation). 
  
Icons  files  contains  the bit-maps of the icons which you can select 
in  the  'Add'  and 'Edit' options in the 'Set desk icons...' and also 
'Set window icons...' menu item dialog boxes. 
  
TeraDesk decides from the screen workstation data whether ICONS.RSC or 
CICONS.RSC  should  be  loaded. If  CICONS.RSC file  can not be found, 
TeraDesk falls back to monochrome ICONS.RSC file. 
  
It  is  recommended  to  have  only  monochrome  icons  in  ICONS.RSC. 
(otherwise  TeraDesk might crash on older single TOSses) In CICONS.RSC 
any sort of icon is allowed. 
  
If  you  do  not  have much memory, and use an AES which is capable of 
handling  colour  icons,  it is possible to just remove CICONS.RSC and 
save quite a lot of memory. 
  
If  you have a resource editor, you can add your own icons to the file 
or  replace  those  already  there by your own. The maximum size of an 
icon is  64 pixels wide by 32 pixels high  and the maximum size of the 
file  is  64 Kb.  Do  not  add other sorts of object  to this resource 
file;  if you do, it will not load.  Owners of a Mega STE  or a TT  or 
any other computer using TOS 2.06 or higher can also  use the resource 
file which comes with these computers in place of ICON.RSC  as long as
they copy it to Tera Desktop's folder and rename it to ICONS.RSC. Many
suitable icon collections can be found on diverse ftp sites as well.
  
The  icons  are  identified by the name held in the icon data. That is 
the 12 characters name in 6X6 font  displayed  under or over the icon. 
This makes it possible to have  the icons in any order in the resource 
file. 
  
There must be at least 7 icons in the file, which are used to represent:  
  
      Floppy disk drives:     icon named  'FLOPPY'  
      Hard disk partitions:   icon named  'HARD DISC'  
      Files:                  icon named  'FILE'  
      Programs:               icon named  'APP' 
      Folders:                icon named  'FOLDER'  
      Trash cans:             icon named  'TRASH'  
      Printers:               icon named  'PRINTER'  
  
Note  that  names  of  the above icons are not hard-coded but are read 
from  DESKTOP.RSC;  thus, it is possible to customize them if TeraDesk 
is translated to other language(s).  
 
If a required icon name can not be  found in  the icons  resource file, 
icon name FILE is tried.  If that does not exist  either,  you loose an 
icon.

You can replace the default icons in the file by others of your choice.

@{U}5.3  Opening objects and icons                                TeraDesk@{u}  
  
An  object  in  a  directory window or on the desktop can be opened by 
double  clicking  on  it or by first selecting it and using the 'Open' 
item in the 'File' menu. 
  
What  happens  when  you open an object depends what sort of object it 
is;  the  results  may  be  modified  in several cases by pressing the 
[Alternate]  key  as  you open the object. Other objects can be opened 
in other ways. The results for the different objects are: 
  
1. Disk volume.  
  
A  new  window  which  contains  the  objects in its root directory is 
opened. 
  
Disk  volumes  may  also  be  opened  by  holding down [Alternate] and 
pressing the key corresponding to the letter of the drive. 
  
If  both  the [Shift] and [Alternate] keys are held down, a new window 
will  not  be  opened,  but  the  directory  will  be displayed in the 
topmost window on the desktop.  
 
2. Folder  
  
If  the  folder is represented by an icon on the desktop, a new window 
containing its directory will be opened. 
  
If  the  folder  is in a directory window, the contents of that window 
will  be replaced by the directory of the folder, as with the standard 
desktop.  If  [Alternate]  is held down as the folder is opened, a new 
window containing its directory will be opened. 
  
Note  that  a  folder  name  '..' behaves differently; it stands for a 
folder  one  level  higher (parent folder). If you open such a folder, 
the  effect  is  to  replace the contents of the window by this higher 
level  directory. If you do this holding down [Alternate] a new window 
is created containing this higher level directory. 
  
3. File.  
  
A.  If  the  file  is  recognized  as  a  program, the program will be 
invoked.  If  the  program is of GTP or TTP type, a dialog box will be 
displayed first. You should enter the parameters required in it. 
  
B.  If  the  file is not a program but matches one of the masks set up 
in  the  'Set  applications' menu item, the associated program will be 
started  and  the  name of the file passed as a parameter. 
  
If  you  hold  down  [Alternate]  as you open the file, the associated 
program  is  not  started  and  it is not recognised as an application 
file. 
  
C.  With all other files, a dialog box is displayed and you can opt to 
Show, Edit or Cancel. 
  
  - If  you  opt to view the file, a window is opened and the contents 
of  the  file  are  displayed in it. If the first 256 bytes contain at 
least  90%  ASCII  character,  the  file  is  displayed in ASCII mode, 
otherwise  it  is  displayed  in HEX mode. See section 6.2 for further 
details. 
  
  - If  you  opt  to edit the file, the application which is marked as 
the  editor  is  run  and  the  name  of the file is passed to it as a 
parameter. 
  
  - If you opt to cancel the action, you return to the Tera Desktop.

@{U}5.4  Dragging Objects                                         TeraDesk@{u}  
  
Icons  or objects (the Source object) can be dragged to other icons or 
objects  (The  Destination  object)  by  holding  down  the left mouse 
button  and  moving  to  a new position on the desktop. When the mouse 
button  is finally released, the result depends on both the source and 
destination object. 
  
The  results for the various destination objects are listed below. The 
first 3 destination require the source to be a file or folder. 
  
1. File(s), Folder(s) -> Disk drive  
  
Source  files  and  folders  (with their contents) are copied into the 
root directory of the destination disk volume. 
  
2. File(s), Folder(s) -> Folder  
  
Source files or folders will be copied into the folder.  
  
3. File, Folder -> Trashcan  
  
The file or the folder together with its contents are deleted.  
  
For the next 3 destinations, the source can only be a file:  
  
4. File -> Program  
  
The  program  is  started  and  the name of the file passed to it as a 
parameter (which it may ignore if it is not of GTP or TTP type). 
  
5. File -> Printer  
  
The contents of the file are sent to the printer.  
  
6. File(s), Folder(s) -> Directory window

Objects dragged to a directory window  will be either copied  or moved 
to it, depending on a keyboard key held pressed  during the operation.
See also Directory windows, Copy and print...

7. File -> Text window

If a single file is dragged  to an  open text window,  the contents of 
the window will be replaced and  the window will display the new file.
If an attempt is made  to drag more than one file,  or an object other
than a file to a text window,  'Illegal copy' error will be generated.
See also Text windows.

8. File(s), Folder(s) -> window of an appications.  

If the window is that of  an application  supporting  AV-protocol, the
VA_DRAGACCWIND  message,  containing  pointers  to   the names of  the 
dragged objects, is sent  to the application,  which  has  to take  an 
action on the dropped object(s). 
  
If  TeraDesk  is running on a suitable multitasking operating system a 
Drag & drop  message  is sent  to  the appication.  If the application 
understands  Drag & Drop, it will take action on the dropped object(s) 
as defined by the application.  
 
If  the  application  doesn't  react, the action will time out and the 
user will be notified.  

See also: Supported Protocols
  
9. File(s), Folder(s), Drive(s) -> Desktop  
  
If  the  source object was already on the desktop, it will be moved to 
a  new  position  defined  by  the  mouse position when the button was 
released. 
  
If  the  source object  was  in a directory window, the object will be 
installed  on the desktop as an icon. Once so installed it can be used 
as if it were in a window. 
 
Note that all copy operations  mentioned above  (except items 7 and 8)
can be modified by pressing [Control] as the mouse button is released. 
When this  is done,  the file or folder  is moved  rather than copied; 
this means  that  the source is  deleted  after  it is  copied  to the 
destination. 
  
If,  instead,  [Alternate]  is  pressed  as  the button is released, a 
dialog  box  is displayed. With the aid of this you can rename the new 
version of the source which is placed in the destination. 

Another way to modify a copy operation is  to press the  left or right 
[Shift] key when the operation  is initiated.  This will  activate the
'Update' or 'Restore' copy modes respectively, in which existing files 
will be overwritten only if they have an older time/date (update mode) 
or a newer  time/date (restore mode) than the file being copied to the 
location. 
  
Note  also  that  if  a file or folder, which is installed in the Tera 
Desktop as an icon, is deleted, the icon is removed as well. 
  
If, during  a  copy  operation, a file or folder with the same name as 
the  source  is  found  in  the destination, a dialog box will appear. 
This  gives  you  the  opportunity  to  rename  either the destination 
object or the source object,  to  overwrite the destination,  to  skip
that file, abort the operation or  to continue.  This dialog box  will 
be appear  in all such instances  of a name  conflict  and can not  be 
switched off.  
 
Finally, note  that a touch, move, copy, delete or print operation can 
be aborted by pressing the [Esc] key.

Symbolic links are  special  files  which contain pointers to files or

(i.e. you have to use Mint or Magic in order to exploit symbolic links
because the standard GEMDOS does not support them).

Symbolic links  can be created by  using the New... menu title  in the
File  menu.  If a  single object  is selected when  this menu title is
activated,  a symbolic link to that object  will be created in the top
directory window.

Symbolic links  are deleted just like normal files and  folders.  Note
that when a link is  deleted the object it  is referencing (target) is
NOT deleted.  During copying and moving, links  are copied/moved,  not
the  actual objects they are referencing.  However, this behaviour can
be modified by checking 'Follow links' in Copy and print...

Information on symbolic links can be read through the  Info... dialog.
It will permit renaming  of the link  or changing  of the path  to the
object it  is referencing  (changing the path to the  target object in
fact amounts to deleting the link and creating a new one).

When an object  which is  a symbolic link is 'opened', the path to the 
target is followed to establish what type  of the object it is  (file,
folder or program). Appropriate action is then taken. 

When an object which is a link is passed as an argument  to a program,
the path to the target is followed  so that the  real object name will
always be passed. 

Note that in the current  version  of TeraDesk  this  may  not  always
work consistently, e.g. if an object is  opened in  a folder  which is
open in an object which  is a link to  a folder,  the  real path  will
not be passed.

When a symbolic link contains only the name of  the referenced object,
TeraDesk will supply the path of the link itself  (and append the name
of  the referenced  object).  Paths  containing  '.\' or '..'  are not 
supported in the current version of TeraDesk.

Manipulation of symbolic links  is a new feature since  TeraDesk 3.22;
it is possible that not everything  yet works correctly. Use with some
caution.

@{U}7  TeraDesk Windows                                           TeraDesk@{u}  
  
Two kinds of windows may be displayed on the desktop:  
  
7.1  Directory windows  
7.2  Text windows  
  
You  can  control  windows  in  the  standard manner using the various 
boxes  and  sliders.  In  Tera  Desktop  you  can also control them by 
pressing various keys; these produce specific effects: 
  
[Clr Home] Jump to top of window  
  
[Shift] [Clr Home] Jump to bottom of window  
  
[<user defined shortcut>]  Close window  
  
[Cursor (arrow)]  These keys scroll the window in the direction of the 
arrow.  If the Shift key is pressed at the same time as the arrow key, 
the  window  scroll  over  a whole page, otherwise by a single line or 
column.  
 
It  is  possible  to  'iconify'  the windows of TeraDesk in the AESses 
which  support that operation  (i.e. which are  AES 4  compatible). An
iconified  window  is  reduced  in  size  so that it contains just one 
icon:  a  file,  a  folder  or  a  disk drive, depending on the window 
content.  To  iconify  a  window, click  on the window gadget, usually 
represented  by  a  triangle, immediately left to the 'Fuller'  gadget
in the upper right corner of the window. Click again to deiconify. 
  
An  iconified  window maintains, until moved, the previous position of 
the upper left corner of the normal window.  If an iconified window is
moved, when it is deiconified it will return to the  position and size
it had at the moment it was iconified.

The 'Fuller'  gadget  in the upper  right corner of  TeraDesk  windows
causes the window to  expand in order to show  as much as possible  of
the window content on the screen. Note that if complete content of the 
window can be displayed on the screen the window will be expanded only
as much as needed- unless any of the [Shift] keys is pressed while the
'Fuller'  gadget is clicked;  in the  latter case the  window  will be
expanded to all of desktop. 

If the 'Fuller' of a fulled window is  clicked again,  the window will
return  to its previous size.  However,  any action which changes  the
extents of the displayed material (such as window sizing, font change,
icon/text mode change, etc.)  will reset  the  'fulled'  state  of the 
window  and the  next click  on the  'Fuller'  will  again  cause  the
window to be fulled to a size appropriate for the new content.

The  contents of a file are displayed. They may be displayed either in 
ASCII mode  or in Hex mode.  
  
ASCII  mode is suitable for readable text files while Hex mode is more 
suitable for binary files.  When opening or re-reading  a text window,
Tera Desktop attempts  to determine the suitable mode by examining the 
contents of the file. 
  
Every  text  window has its own menu bar with one title, 'Viewer'. You 
must  click  on  this  to  see the two items it contains. i.e. it is a 
click-down rather than a drop-down menu. 
  
The  first item, 'Tabsize' , shows a dialog box when selected. In this 
you  can  set  the  tab size; the number of columns skipped when a Tab 
symbol is encountered in the text. 
  
The second,  'Hexmode',  enables  you to toggle between ASCII mode and 
Hex mode. When 'Hexmode' is ticked, the file is shown in hex mode. 
 
Certain keyboard keys,  beside  those already mentioned,  have special 
effects an a text window:  
  
Pressing the [Space] key causes scrolling to to next page.  
  
Pressing the [Return] key causes scrolling to the next line.  

Pressing the  [Esc]  key causes the contents of the top text window to 
be read again and window to be refreshed.  

Dragging a -single- file  to a text window will cause  the contents of 
the window to be replaced with  the contents of the dragged file (this
can be faster than opening a new text window).

TeraDesk 3.* can use two configuration files:  
  
TERADESK.INF holds the complete configuration of the Desktop.  
TERADESK.PAL holds the colour palette.  
  
Contrary  to  TeraDesk  V2.*,  which  used a binary configuration file 
named  DESKTOP.CFG,  the  configuration  files of TeraDesk V3.* are in 
plain ASCII text form. Information in the files is divided into blocks 
which  are  delimited by { } parentheses and  identified  by  keywords
preceeding them, e.g:

  icon=
  {
    name=EVEREST
    labl=EVEREST
    type=6
    tgtt=6
    path=D:\EDITORS\EVEREST\EVEREST.PRG
    xpos=7
    ypos=3
  }

Blocks  of  information  in the configuration files  are structured by 
blank  lines and indentation of one or several <TAB> characters.  This 
is purely a cosmetic effect. 

In  order  to  save  space,  lines  in  the  configuration  files  are 
terminated   by  <LF>   only   (this  can  be  easily  changed  during 
compilation  of the  program).  However, TeraDesk will not complain of 
<CR><LF> line termination either. 

Although the configration files of TeraDesk 3.* are  in the text form, 
they are NOT intended to be edited by hand, although it is possible to 
do so. Text form of the configuration files is  a  consequence  of the 
implementation of the 'keyword  =  value'  concept which makes it much 
easier to test  file contents  and  to maintain compatibility  between 
upgrades.  Editing  configuration  files  by  hand,  unless  you  know 
-exactly-  what  you  are  doing, can cause undesired effects, or even 
crash TeraDesk.

However, currently there are two items in the configuration file which
can be changed -only- by  editing the file  (but normally there  would
not be any need to do so). Those are:

help=ST-GUIDE (name of the hypertext help program- 8 characters max.)
maxd=256      (initial number of directory entries in windows).
  
The  palette  file  is  optional  and  can  be used  to restore colour 
palette  after  programs which  corrupt it.  Whether it is used or not 
can be specified in Video options... 
  
If you want to convert your old TeraDesk V2.* configuration file(s) to 
the new format,  use  CFG2INF.PRG (see Installation).

In  GEMDOS the length of a command line is limited  to 125 characters. 
The ARGV protocol  makes  much longer command lines possible.  This is
done by passing the parameters through the ARGV environment variable. 
  
A disadvantage  of the  protocol is  that many programs do not support 
such  long  command  lines  and may  even crash.  For this reason Tera 
Desktop  enables  you  to  switch  the protocol on and off in 
Set applications... and Set program types...  
 
There  are  two  ways  you  can  avoid  this difficulty  with the ARGV 
protocol: 
  
1. Install  programs  which  do not support the ARGV separately  using 
the 'Set  program  types...' menu item.  Enter their full names in the 
list  of program mask but switch off the ARGV protocol for them.  Make 
sure  you enter their names nearer to the top of the programtypes list 
than any masks which they might match. 
  
2. Do the reverse of 1:  Switch off the ARGV protocol for all programs 
but enter the names of those that do separately. 
  
Another  possibility is to install them  as applications with the ARGV 
protocol switched off.

@{U}9.2  The AV Protocol                                          TeraDesk@{u}  

@autorefoff
The AV protocol  (first developed for use with Gemini desktop)  allows
@autorefon
certain blocks  of  information  to  be  passed  between  concurrently
running applications, and certain actions  to be performed  based upon
that information.  In order to utilize this protocol an 'AV-Server' is 
declared through an environment variable, e.g. for TeraDesk:

  AVSERVER=DESKTOP

Clients using this protocol  sign-on to the server and request certain
actions by sending messages. Generally,  the server performs an action
and replies by sending an appropriate acknowledgment message.
  
TeraDesk currently supports  a  large subset  of  AV-protocol  message
exchanges (listed below as request/reply):

AV_PROTOKOLL/VA_PROTOSTATUS:Establish client-server communication and
                            inform each other of capabilities.

AV_EXIT:                    Terminate communication. 
                            
AV_SENDKEY:                 Pass an unused key code to the server

VA_START/AV_STARTED:        Pass parameter(s) to the client. AV_STARTED
                            reply is ignored.

AV_ASKFILEFONT/VA_FILEFONT: Ask the server about the current 
                            directory window font

AV_ASKCONFONT/VA_CONFONT:   Ask the server about the current console
                            window font. Currently TeraDesk replies
                            by sending the directory window font 
                            info. 
                            
VA_FONTCHANGED:             Inform the AV-client which has previously
                            demanded an info on the directory font 
                            that the font has changed.
                                                           
AV_OPENWIND/VA_WINDOPEN:    Tell the server to open a directory 
                            window with the given path.

AV_XWIND/VA_XOPEN:          Similar to the above, but with additional
                            parameters passed. Currently, some of these
                            additional parameters are ignored, so this
                            capability is not fully compliant to the
                            specifications.
                            
AV_ACCWINDOPEN:             Inform the server that the client has 
                            opened a window. This window is then 
                            included in TeraDesk's window cycling and
                            can also be closed from TeraDesks Window 
                            menu.
                            
AV_ACCWINDCLOSED:           Inform the server that the client has 
                            closed a window.
                            
VA_DRAGACCWIND:             Inform the client that objects have been
                            placed to its window.
                            
AV_COPY_DRAGGED/VA_COPY_COMPLETE:   Replies to to VA_DRAGACCWIND

AV_DRAG_ON_WINDOW/VA_DRAG_COMPLETE: Inform the server that objects
                                    have been placed on its windows 
                                    or the desktop. 
                                                                                                                              
AV_STARTPROG/VA_PROGSTART:  Tell the server to start an application
                            with a given name, or an application 
                            which will open a file with a given name.  
                            
AV_VIEW/VA_VIEWED:          Tell the server to start an application
                            which is the viewer for the given file.
                            Currently, TeraDesk does not distinguish
                            between filetype-specific viewers and
                            processing applications, and will start
                            the first application for which the given
                            filetype is assigned.
                            
AV_PATH_UPDATE:             Tell the server to update a window with
                            the given path.         
                            
AV_FILEINFO/VA_FILECHANGED  Tell the server to show information on the
                            files the names of which are passed.
                            
AV_DELFILE/VA_FILEDELETED   Tell the server to delete some files.

AV_COPYFILE/VA_FILECOPIED   Tell the server to copy some files. In the
                            current implementation, this function is 
                            not fully compliant to specifications: 
                            symbolic links can not be created.
                             
VA_PATH_UPDATE              Inform clients of a change in a directory. 
                            In the current implementation the server 
                            does not send this information to the 
                            client to which some other reply is in 
                            progress. 

AV_STATUS                   Ask the server to save client's status  
                   
AV_GETSTATUS/VA_SETSTATUS   Aks the server about saved client status

AV_SETWINDPOS               Fix the position of the next client window

                                                             
Messages currently not supported:

AV_OPENCONSOLE/VA_CONSOLEOPEN  Open the console window 
AV_ASKOBJECT/VA_OBJECT         Ask for names of selected objects

In the Single-TOS version, only the following messages are supported:

AV_PROTOKOLL/VA_PROTOSTATUS
AV_EXIT
AV_SENDKEY
VA_START/AV_STARTED
AV_ASKFILEFONT/VA_FILEFONT
AV_ACCWINDOPEN
AV_ACCWINDCLOSED
VA_DRAGACCWIND
AV_COPY_DRAGGED/VA_COPY_COMPLETE
AV_STARTPROG/VA_PROGSTARTED

This limitation is a consequence of the desire to reduce the size of
the Desktop program by  removing options which are  very unlikely to
be used in Single-TOS. However, TeraDesk can be compiled for Single-
TOS with full AV-protocol support as well.

In a multitasking environment with  memory protection,  TeraDesk may
run into problems  with some AV-protocol clients,  and fail with the
'memory protection: type private' error.  This will most probably be
a fault of a  badly programmed AV-protocol client.  In some cases it 
can be  cured if  the memory-protection flag  in  the header  of the  
offending AV-protocol-client is set to 'readable' or  (if it doesn't 
help)  to  'supervisor'  or  'global'.  An example of  such  case is 
ST-Guide.

TeraDesk supports the most important functions  of the  FONT protocol, 
which was introduced by Christian Grunenberg.

TeraDesk can be installed  as a  font selector for  other applications  
supporting this protocol  (e.g. ST-Guide).  When  an applications asks 
for a font change, The font selector of TeraDesk will be opened.

For successful operation the following criteria must be fulfilled:

-TeraDesk  must be running  in  parallel to  the application-   either
 the application running  as  a desk accessory under Single-TOS or one
 working in a multitasking environment

-The environmental variable FONTSELECT must be set:

This protocol was introduced by Atari for MultiTOS.

This protocol  is automatically  operated if  one or more objects in a 
window  are   Drag & Dropped  onto  a  window  belonging  to   another 
application.  TeraDesk can currently  operate only  as  a  Drag & Drop
sender,  i.e. it can not  receive objects  dragged to its windows from
other applications (however,  TeraDesk can act both as a sender and as
a receiver when objects are drag & dropped using the AV-protocol).
