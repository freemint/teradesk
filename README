BUILDING

To build Teradesk you will need PureC 1.0. Start PureC, load
teradesk\desktop.prj and build the project.

It is possible to build a MiNT version of Teradesk (long filenames, etc.). To
do this make links of all sources in the teradesk subdirectory to the mintdesk
subdirectory (on a Minix filesystem) or copy all sources. Adapt the Makefile and
run GNU make.
